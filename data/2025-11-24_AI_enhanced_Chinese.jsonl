Here we propose TS-DFM, a flow matching framework that predicts TSs from reactants and products. By operating in molecular distance geometry space, TS-DFM explicitly captures the dynamic changes of interatomic distances in chemical reactions. A network structure named TSDVNet is designed to learn the velocity field for generating TS geometries accurately. On the benchmark dataset Transition1X, TS-DFM outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method React-OT by 30\\% in structural accuracy. These predicted TSs provide high-quality initial structures, accelerating the convergence of CI-NEB optimization. Additionally, TS-DFM can identify alternative reaction paths. In our experiments, even a more favorable TS with lower energy barrier is discovered. Further tests on RGD1 dataset confirm its strong generalization ability on unseen molecules and reaction types, highlighting its potential for facilitating reaction exploration.", "abs": "", "categories": ["cs.LG", "physics.chem-ph"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出了一种基于距离几何的流匹配框架TS-DFM，用于预测化学反应的过渡态，显著提高了过渡态结构预测的准确性，并能发现更优的反应路径。", "motivation": "实验和计算方法难以有效探索过渡态，而过渡态对于理解反应机理至关重要，因此需要一种高效准确的过渡态预测方法。", "method": "TS-DFM框架在分子距离几何空间中运行，通过学习速度场来生成过渡态几何结构。设计了TSDV Net网络结构，用于准确学习速度场，并利用流匹配技术进行过渡态预测。", "result": "在Transition1X数据集上，TS-DFM在结构准确性方面比现有最先进方法React-OT提高了30%，能够加速CI-NEB优化，并发现更优的过渡态和反应路径。在RGD1数据集上的测试也验证了其泛化能力。", "conclusion": "TS-DFM为化学反应探索提供了一种强大的工具，有望加速催化剂设计、反应条件优化和新合成路线开发等领域的研究。"}}
