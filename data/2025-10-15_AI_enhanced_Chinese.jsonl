Chen", "Brandon Wood", "Guan-Horng Liu", "Benjamin Kurt Miller"], "summary": "Diffusion-based samplers learn to sample complex, high-dimensional distributions using energies or log densities alone, without training data. Yet, they remain impractical for molecular sampling because they are often slower than molecular dynamics and miss thermodynamically relevant modes. Inspired by enhanced sampling, we encourage exploration by introducing a sequential bias along bespoke, information-rich, low-dimensional projections of atomic coordinates known as collective variables (CVs). We introduce a repulsive potential centered on the CVs from recent samples, which pushes future samples towards novel CV regions and effectively increases the temperature in the projected space. Our resulting method improves efficiency, mode discovery, enables the estimation of free energy differences, and retains independent sampling from the approximate Boltzmann distribution via reweighting by the bias. On standard peptide conformational sampling benchmarks, the method recovers diverse conformational states and accurate free energy profiles. We are the first to demonstrate reactive sampling using a diffusion-based sampler, capturing bond breaking and formation with universal interatomic potentials at near-first-principles accuracy. The approach resolves reactive energy landscapes at a fraction of the wall-clock time of standard sampling methods, advancing diffusion-based sampling towards practical use in molecular sciences.", "abs": "", "categories": ["physics.chem-ph", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出了一种结合分子集体变量的扩散采样方法，显著提高了分子采样效率，并实现了对反应过程的精确模拟。", "motivation": "传统的扩散采样方法在分子采样中速度慢、难以发现热力学相关模式，且难以模拟化学反应。因此，需要一种更高效、更准确的分子采样方法。", "method": "该方法通过引入基于分子集体变量（CVs）的排斥势，引导扩散采样过程向新的CV区域移动，从而增加投影空间的温度，并使用偏置重整化来保持近似玻尔兹曼分布的独立采样。", "result": "实验结果表明，该方法在肽构象采样基准测试中能够恢复多样化的构象状态和准确的热力学曲线，实现了近第一性原理准确度的键断裂和形成过程的反应采样，且速度远快于传统采样方法。", "conclusion": "该研究将扩散采样方法应用于分子科学领域，解决了反应能量景观的解析问题，为分子模拟的实际应用提供了新的途径。"}}
{"id": "2510.12293", "title": "General Fourier Feature Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machine (GFF-PIELM) for High-Frequency PDEs", "authors": ["Fei Ren", "Sifan Wang", "Pei-Zhi Zhuang", "Hai-Sui Yu", "He Yang"], "summary": "Conventional physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) often faces challenges in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) involving high-frequency and variable-frequency behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose a general Fourier feature physics-informed extreme learning machine (GFF-PIELM). We demonstrate that directly concatenating multiple Fourier feature mappings (FFMs) and an extreme learning machine (ELM) network makes it difficult to determine frequency-related hyperparameters. Fortunately, we find an alternative to establish the GFF-PIELM in three main steps. First, we integrate a variation of FFM into ELM as the Fourier-based activation function, so there is still one hidden layer in the GFF-PIELM framework. Second, we assign a set of frequency coefficients to the hidden neurons, which enables ELM network to capture diverse frequency components of target solutions. Finally, we develop an innovative, straightforward initialization method for these hyperparameters by monitoring the distribution of ELM output weights. GFF-PIELM not only retains the high accuracy, efficiency, and simplicity of the PIELM framework but also inherits the ability of FFMs to effectively handle high-frequency problems. We carry out five case studies with a total of ten numerical examples to highlight the feasibility and validity of the proposed GFF-PIELM, involving high frequency, variable frequency, multi-scale behaviour, irregular boundary and inverse problems. Compared to conventional PIELM, the GFF-PIELM approach significantly improves predictive accuracy without additional cost in training time and architecture complexity. Our results confirm that that PIELM can be extended to solve high-frequency and variable-frequency PDEs with high accuracy, and our initialization strategy may further inspire advances in other physics-informed machine learning (PIML) frameworks.", "abs": "", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.NE", "physics.comp-ph"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出了一种通用傅里叶特征物理信息极端学习机 (GFF-PIELM)，用于解决高频偏微分方程 (PDEs)。该方法结合了傅里叶特征映射和极端学习机，有效提高了高频问题的预测精度。", "motivation": "传统物理信息极端学习机 (PIELM) 在解决涉及高频和变频行为的 PDEs 时面临挑战。PINNs在处理高频或多尺度行为的PDEs时，往往无法提供可接受的精度，且训练效率较低。", "method": "GFF-PIELM 将傅里叶特征映射 (FFM) 集成到 ELM 中作为基于傅里叶的激活函数，并为隐藏神经元分配一组频率系数，从而使 ELM 网络能够捕捉目标解的各种频率成分。此外，提出了一种基于 ELM 输出权重分布的创新型超参数初始化方法。", "result": "通过五个案例研究，GFF-PIELM 在高频、变频、多尺度行为、不规则边界和逆问题等方面表现出可行性和有效性。与传统 PIELM 相比，GFF-PIELM 显著提高了预测精度，且无需额外的训练时间和架构复杂度。", "conclusion": "研究结果表明，PIELM 可以扩展到高频和变频 PDEs 的高精度求解，且提出的初始化策略可能进一步启发其他物理信息机器学习 (PIML) 框架的进步。"}}
