The most commonly studied measure, Hessian sharpness ($λ_{\\max}^H$) -- the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian -- determines local training stability and interacts with the learning rate throughout training. Despite its significance in analyzing training dynamics, direct measurement of Hessian sharpness remains prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to high computational cost. We analyze $\\textit{critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c$), a computationally efficient measure requiring fewer than $10$ forward passes given the update direction $Δ\\mathbfθ$. Critically, this measure captures well-documented Hessian sharpness phenomena, including progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability. Using this measure, we provide the first demonstration of these sharpness phenomena at scale, up to $7$B parameters, spanning both pre-training and mid-training of OLMo-2 models. We further introduce $\\textit{relative critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c^{1\\to 2}$), which quantifies the curvature of one loss landscape while optimizing another, to analyze the transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and guide data mixing strategies. Critical sharpness provides practitioners with a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics and informing data composition choices at scale. More broadly, our work shows that scalable curvature measures can provide actionable insights for large-scale training.", "abs": "", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cond-mat.dis-nn", "cs.AI", "stat.ML"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出了一种计算高效的损失景观曲率度量“关键尖锐度”(critical sharpness)，并将其应用于大型语言模型(LLMs)的训练动态分析，揭示了大规模训练中的尖锐度现象，并为数据混合策略提供了指导。", "motivation": "传统的Hessian sharpness计算成本高昂，难以应用于LLMs。因此，需要一种可扩展且计算效率高的曲率度量来分析LLMs的训练动态。", "method": "研究人员提出了“关键尖锐度”(critical sharpness) λc，只需要少于10次前向传播即可计算，并进一步提出了相对关键尖锐度(relative critical sharpness) λ1→2c来分析预训练到微调的过渡。他们使用该度量分析了OLMo-2模型在预训练和中期训练中的尖锐度现象。", "result": "首次在大规模模型（高达7B参数）上观察到LLMs的尖锐度现象，包括渐进式锐化和稳定性边缘。相对关键尖锐度能够有效量化不同损失景观之间的曲率差异，并指导数据混合策略。", "conclusion": "关键尖锐度提供了一种实用的工具来诊断曲率动态并指导大规模训练中的数据组成选择。该工作表明，可扩展的曲率度量可以为大规模训练提供可操作的见解。"}}
