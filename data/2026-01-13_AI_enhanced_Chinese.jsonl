Vasconcelos", "Mauricio Girardi-Schappo"], "summary": "The Hopfield model, originally inspired by spin-glass physics, occupies a central place at the intersection of statistical mechanics, neural networks, and modern artificial intelligence. Despite its conceptual simplicity and broad applicability -- from associative memory to near-optimal solutions of combinatorial optimization problems -- it is rarely integrated into standard undergraduate physics curricula. In this paper, we present the Hopfield model as a pedagogically rich framework that naturally unifies core topics from undergraduate statistical physics, dynamical systems, linear algebra, and computational methods. We provide a concise and illustrated theoretical introduction grounded in familiar physics concepts, analyze the model's energy function, dynamics, and pattern stability, and discuss practical aspects of simulation, including a freely available simulation code. To support instruction, we conclude with classroom-ready example problems designed to mirror research practice. By explicitly connecting fundamental physics to contemporary AI applications, this work aims to help prepare physics students to understand, apply, and critically engage with the computational tools increasingly central to research, industry, and society.", "abs": "", "categories": ["cond-mat.dis-nn", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "physics.comp-ph", "physics.ed-ph"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文将Hopfield模型引入到本科物理课程中，旨在将统计物理、动力系统、线性代数和计算方法等核心概念与现代人工智能应用联系起来，培养学生运用计算工具解决问题的能力。", "motivation": "尽管本科物理课程提供了必要的概念基础，但这些概念往往被孤立地教授，难以让学生认识到它们在当代应用中的相关性。Hopfield模型提供了一个明确连接这些概念的框架。", "method": "本文以熟悉的物理概念为基础，对Hopfield模型进行了简洁的理论介绍，分析了模型的能量函数、动力学和模式稳定性，并提供了可自由使用的模拟代码，以及可用于课堂教学的示例问题。", "result": "通过将基本物理学与当代人工智能应用显式地联系起来，该研究提供了一个将统计物理的伊辛模型与Hopfield模型联系起来的教学框架，并提供了模拟代码和示例问题。", "conclusion": "该工作旨在帮助物理学生理解、应用和批判性地参与日益重要的计算工具，为他们在研究、工业和社会中应用物理知识和推理做好准备。"}}

Here we develop a machine learning framework for adiabatic lattice dynamics coupled to nonequilibrium electrons, and demonstrate it for a gating induced insulator to metal transition out of a charge density wave state in the Holstein model. Although exact electronic forces can be obtained from nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) calculations, their high computational cost renders long time dynamical simulations prohibitively expensive. By exploiting the locality of the electronic response, we train a neural network to directly predict instantaneous local electronic forces from the lattice configuration, thereby bypassing repeated NEGF calculations during time evolution. When combined with Brownian dynamics, the resulting machine learning force field quantitatively reproduces domain wall motion and nonequilibrium phase transition dynamics obtained from full NEGF simulations, while achieving orders of magnitude gains in computational efficiency. Our results establish direct force learning as an efficient and accurate approach for simulating nonequilibrium lattice dynamics in driven quantum materials.", "abs": "", "categories": ["cond-mat.str-el", "cs.LG", "physics.comp-ph"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出了一种基于机器学习的框架，用于模拟电压驱动的非平衡相变，通过直接学习电子力，显著提高了计算效率，并成功模拟了电荷密度波绝缘体到金属的转变。", "motivation": "传统的非平衡态电子力计算成本高昂，限制了长时间动态模拟。现有机器学习力场方法主要基于能量，难以处理非保守力，因此需要开发能够学习和预测非平衡非保守力的机器学习框架。", "method": "利用电子响应的局域性，训练神经网络直接预测瞬时局部电子力，从而避免重复的非平衡格林函数（NEGF）计算。将机器学习力场与布朗动力学相结合，模拟了电荷密度波绝缘体到金属的转变。", "result": "机器学习力场能够定量地再现从完整NEGF模拟获得的结果，包括畴壁运动和非平衡相变动力学，同时实现了数量级的计算效率提升。", "conclusion": "该研究证明了直接力学习是一种高效且准确的模拟驱动量子材料非平衡晶格动力学的有效方法，为扩展机器学习加速模拟到驱动、开放和远离平衡的量子系统提供了新的途径。"}}

Loeffler", "Henry Chan", "Sukriti Manna", "Orcun Yildiz", "Tom Peterka", "Subramanian Sankaranarayanan"], "summary": "High-dimensional design spaces underpin a wide range of physics-based modeling and computational design tasks in science and engineering. These problems are commonly formulated as constrained black-box searches over rugged objective landscapes, where function evaluations are expensive, and gradients are unavailable or unreliable. Conventional global search engines and optimizers struggle in such settings due to the exponential scaling of design spaces, the presence of multiple local basins, and the absence of physical guidance in sampling. We present a physics-informed Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework that extends policy-driven tree-based reinforcement concepts to continuous, high-dimensional scientific optimization. Our method integrates population-level decision trees with surrogate-guided directional sampling, reward shaping, and hierarchical switching between global exploration and local exploitation. These ingredients allow efficient traversal of non-convex, multimodal landscapes where physically meaningful optima are sparse. We benchmark our approach against standard global optimization baselines on a suite of canonical test functions, demonstrating superior or comparable performance in terms of convergence, robustness, and generalization. Beyond synthetic tests, we demonstrate physics-consistent applicability to (i) crystal structure optimization from clusters to bulk, (ii) fitting of classical interatomic potentials, and (iii) constrained engineering design problems. Across all cases, the method converges with high fidelity and evaluation efficiency while preserving physical constraints. Overall, our work establishes physics-informed tree search as a scalable and interpretable paradigm for computational design and high-dimensional scientific optimization, bridging discrete decision-making frameworks with continuous search in scientific design workflows.", "abs": "", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cond-mat.mtrl-sci", "physics.comp-ph", "physics.data-an"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出了一种基于物理信息的蒙特卡洛树搜索 (MCTS) 框架，用于解决高维计算设计问题，该框架结合了决策树、代理引导采样和奖励塑造，以高效地探索复杂目标景观。", "motivation": "传统优化算法在高维、非凸、多模态的物理约束设计问题中面临挑战，例如函数评估成本高昂且梯度不可用。需要一种更有效的、具有物理指导意义的优化方法。", "method": "该方法将基于树的强化学习概念扩展到连续高维科学优化，通过集成人口级决策树、代理引导方向采样、奖励塑造以及全局探索和局部利用之间的分层切换来实现高效的景观遍历。", "result": "在标准全局优化基准测试函数上，该方法表现出优越或可比的性能，并在晶体结构优化、原子间势拟合和受约束的工程设计问题中实现了高保真度和评估效率，同时保留了物理约束。", "conclusion": "该研究确立了物理信息树搜索作为一种可扩展且可解释的计算设计和高维科学优化范例，将离散决策框架与连续黑盒搜索相结合，为科学设计工作流程提供了一种新的途径。"}}
