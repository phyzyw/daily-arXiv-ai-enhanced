This paper presents machine-learning-driven reduced models for Electron Temperature Gradient (ETG) turbulence in the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarator. Each model predicts the ETG heat flux as a function of three plasma parameters: the normalized electron temperature radial gradient ($\\omega_{T_e}$), the ratio of normalized electron temperature and density radial gradients ($\\eta_e$), and the electron-to-ion temperature ratio ($\\tau$). We first construct models across seven radial locations using regression and an active machine-learning-based procedure. This process initializes models using low-cardinality sparse-grid training data and then iteratively refines their training sets by selecting the most informative points from a pre-existing simulation database. We evaluate the prediction capabilities of our models using out-of-sample datasets with over $393$ points per location, and $95\\%$ prediction intervals are estimated via bootstrapping to assess prediction uncertainty. We then investigate the construction of generalized reduced models, including a generic, position-independent model, and assess their heat flux prediction capabilities at three additional locations. Our models demonstrate robust performance and predictive accuracy comparable to the original reference simulations, even when applied beyond the training domain.", "published": "2025-11-06", "categories": ["physics.plasm-ph", "cs.CE", "cs.LG", "physics.comp-ph"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04567v1", "primary_category": "physics.plasm-ph"}
{"id": "2511.04564", "title": "Uncertainties in Physics-informed Inverse Problems: The Hidden Risk in Scientific AI", "authors": ["Yoh-ichi Mototake", "Makoto Sasaki"], "summary": "Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) integrates partial differential equations (PDEs) into machine learning models to solve inverse problems, such as estimating coefficient functions (e.g., the Hamiltonian function) that characterize physical systems. This framework enables data-driven understanding and prediction of complex physical phenomena. While coefficient functions in PIML are typically estimated on the basis of predictive performance, physics as a discipline does not rely solely on prediction accuracy to evaluate models. For example, Kepler's heliocentric model was favored owing to small discrepancies in planetary motion, despite its similar predictive accuracy to the geocentric model. This highlights the inherent uncertainties in data-driven model inference and the scientific importance of selecting physically meaningful solutions. In this paper, we propose a framework to quantify and analyze such uncertainties in the estimation of coefficient functions in PIML. We apply our framework to reduced model of magnetohydrodynamics and our framework shows that there are uncertainties, and unique identification is possible with geometric constraints. Finally, we confirm that we can estimate the reduced model uniquely by incorporating these constraints.", "published": "2025-11-06", "categories": ["physics.comp-ph", "cs.LG"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04564v1", "primary_category": "physics.comp-ph"}

Katona", "Emily K. de Jong", "Nipun Gunawardena"], "summary": "Reduced-order models (ROMs) can efficiently simulate high-dimensional physical systems, but lack robust uncertainty quantification methods. Existing approaches are frequently architecture- or training-specific, which limits flexibility and generalization. We introduce a post hoc, model-agnostic framework for predictive uncertainty quantification in latent space ROMs that requires no modification to the underlying architecture or training procedure. Using conformal prediction, our approach estimates statistical prediction intervals for multiple components of the ROM pipeline: latent dynamics, reconstruction, and end-to-end predictions. We demonstrate the method on a latent space dynamical model for cloud microphysics, where it accurately predicts the evolution of droplet-size distributions and quantifies uncertainty across the ROM pipeline.", "published": "2025-11-06", "categories": ["cs.LG", "physics.ao-ph", "physics.comp-ph", "I.6.5; I.2.6; G.3; J.2"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04534v1", "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
