Vasconcelos", "Mauricio Girardi-Schappo"], "summary": "The Hopfield model, originally inspired by spin-glass physics, occupies a central place at the intersection of statistical mechanics, neural networks, and modern artificial intelligence. Despite its conceptual simplicity and broad applicability -- from associative memory to near-optimal solutions of combinatorial optimization problems -- it is rarely integrated into standard undergraduate physics curricula. In this paper, we present the Hopfield model as a pedagogically rich framework that naturally unifies core topics from undergraduate statistical physics, dynamical systems, linear algebra, and computational methods. We provide a concise and illustrated theoretical introduction grounded in familiar physics concepts, analyze the model's energy function, dynamics, and pattern stability, and discuss practical aspects of simulation, including a freely available simulation code. To support instruction, we conclude with classroom-ready example problems designed to mirror research practice. By explicitly connecting fundamental physics to contemporary AI applications, this work aims to help prepare physics students to understand, apply, and critically engage with the computational tools increasingly central to research, industry, and society.", "published": "2026-01-12", "categories": ["cond-mat.dis-nn", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "physics.comp-ph", "physics.ed-ph"], "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.07635v1", "primary_category": "cond-mat.dis-nn"}

Here we develop a machine learning framework for adiabatic lattice dynamics coupled to nonequilibrium electrons, and demonstrate it for a gating induced insulator to metal transition out of a charge density wave state in the Holstein model. Although exact electronic forces can be obtained from nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) calculations, their high computational cost renders long time dynamical simulations prohibitively expensive. By exploiting the locality of the electronic response, we train a neural network to directly predict instantaneous local electronic forces from the lattice configuration, thereby bypassing repeated NEGF calculations during time evolution. When combined with Brownian dynamics, the resulting machine learning force field quantitatively reproduces domain wall motion and nonequilibrium phase transition dynamics obtained from full NEGF simulations, while achieving orders of magnitude gains in computational efficiency. Our results establish direct force learning as an efficient and accurate approach for simulating nonequilibrium lattice dynamics in driven quantum materials.", "published": "2026-01-12", "categories": ["cond-mat.str-el", "cs.LG", "physics.comp-ph"], "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.07583v1", "primary_category": "cond-mat.str-el"}

Loeffler", "Henry Chan", "Sukriti Manna", "Orcun Yildiz", "Tom Peterka", "Subramanian Sankaranarayanan"], "summary": "High-dimensional design spaces underpin a wide range of physics-based modeling and computational design tasks in science and engineering. These problems are commonly formulated as constrained black-box searches over rugged objective landscapes, where function evaluations are expensive, and gradients are unavailable or unreliable. Conventional global search engines and optimizers struggle in such settings due to the exponential scaling of design spaces, the presence of multiple local basins, and the absence of physical guidance in sampling. We present a physics-informed Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework that extends policy-driven tree-based reinforcement concepts to continuous, high-dimensional scientific optimization. Our method integrates population-level decision trees with surrogate-guided directional sampling, reward shaping, and hierarchical switching between global exploration and local exploitation. These ingredients allow efficient traversal of non-convex, multimodal landscapes where physically meaningful optima are sparse. We benchmark our approach against standard global optimization baselines on a suite of canonical test functions, demonstrating superior or comparable performance in terms of convergence, robustness, and generalization. Beyond synthetic tests, we demonstrate physics-consistent applicability to (i) crystal structure optimization from clusters to bulk, (ii) fitting of classical interatomic potentials, and (iii) constrained engineering design problems. Across all cases, the method converges with high fidelity and evaluation efficiency while preserving physical constraints. Overall, our work establishes physics-informed tree search as a scalable and interpretable paradigm for computational design and high-dimensional scientific optimization, bridging discrete decision-making frameworks with continuous search in scientific design workflows.", "published": "2026-01-10", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cond-mat.mtrl-sci", "physics.comp-ph", "physics.data-an"], "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.06444v1", "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
