{"id": "2511.11415", "title": "Differentiation Strategies for Acoustic Inverse Problems: Admittance Estimation and Shape Optimization", "authors": ["Nikolas Borrel-Jensen", "Josiah Bjorgaard"], "summary": "We demonstrate a practical differentiable programming approach for acoustic inverse problems through two applications: admittance estimation and shape optimization for resonance damping. First, we show that JAX-FEM's automatic differentiation (AD) enables direct gradient-based estimation of complex boundary admittance from sparse pressure measurements, achieving 3-digit precision without requiring manual derivation of adjoint equations. Second, we apply randomized finite differences to acoustic shape optimization, combining JAX-FEM for forward simulation with PyTorch3D for mesh manipulation through AD. By separating physics-driven boundary optimization from geometry-driven interior mesh adaptation, we achieve 48.1% energy reduction at target frequencies with 30-fold fewer FEM solutions compared to standard finite difference on the full mesh. This work showcases how modern differentiable software stacks enable rapid prototyping of optimization workflows for physics-based inverse problems, with automatic differentiation for parameter estimation and a combination of finite differences and AD for geometric design.", "published": "2025-11-14", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CE", "physics.comp-ph"], "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11415v1", "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
