{"id": "2509.18758", "title": "Complexity of Activity Patterns in a Bio-Inspired Hopfield-Type Network in Different Topologies", "authors": ["Marco Cafiso", "Paolo Paradisi"], "summary": "Neural network models capable of storing memory have been extensively studied in computer science and computational neuroscience. The Hopfield network is a prototypical example of a model designed for associative, or content-addressable, memory and has been analyzed in many forms. Further, ideas and methods from complex network theory have been incorporated into artificial neural networks and learning, emphasizing their structural properties. Nevertheless, the temporal dynamics also play a vital role in biological neural networks, whose temporal structure is a crucial feature to examine. Biological neural networks display complex intermittency and, thus, can be studied through the lens of the temporal complexity (TC) theory. The TC approach look at the metastability of self-organized states, characterized by a power-law decay in the inter-event time distribution and in the total activity distribution or a scaling behavior in the corresponding event-driven diffusion processes. In this study, we present a temporal complexity (TC) analysis of a biologically-inspired Hopfield-type neural network model. We conducted a comparative assessment between scale-free and random network topologies, with particular emphasis on their global activation patterns. Our parametric analysis revealed comparable dynamical behaviors across both neural network architectures. Furthermore, our investigation into temporal complexity characteristics uncovered that seemingly distinct dynamical patterns exhibit similar temporal complexity behaviors. In particular, similar power-law decay in the activity distribution and similar complexity levels are observed in both topologies, but with a much reduced noise in the scale-free topology. Notably, most of the complex dynamical profiles were consistently observed in scale-free network configurations, thus confirming the crucial role of hubs in neural network dynamics.", "abs": "", "categories": ["q-bio.NC", "cs.AI", "nlin.AO", "physics.bio-ph"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文研究了不同拓扑结构（无规和无标度）的生物启发式Hopfield网络中的活动模式复杂性，并利用时间复杂度理论分析其动态行为。", "motivation": "生物神经网络表现出复杂的间歇性，而时间复杂度理论可以用来研究其自组织状态的稳态性。本文旨在将时间复杂度分析应用于Hopfield网络，以理解网络拓扑结构对动态行为的影响。", "method": "研究人员对生物启发式Hopfield网络模型进行了时间复杂度分析，比较了无规和无标度网络拓扑的全局激活模式。他们分析了活动分布和事件驱动扩散过程的幂律衰减，以评估时间复杂度。", "result": "研究发现，尽管网络架构不同，但无规和无标度网络表现出相似的动态行为和时间复杂度特征。无标度网络在活动分布中表现出更低的噪声，并且复杂的动态模式主要出现在无标度网络配置中，表明中心节点在神经网络动态中起着关键作用。", "conclusion": "该研究证实了时间复杂度理论可以有效地分析神经网络的动态行为，并强调了无标度网络中中心节点在神经网络动态中的重要性。这些发现有助于更好地理解生物神经网络的复杂性，并为设计更有效的神经网络模型提供指导。"}}
