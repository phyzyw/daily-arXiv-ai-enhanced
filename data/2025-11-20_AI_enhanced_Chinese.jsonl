In this study, we propose a multi-fidelity neural network (MFNN) approach to fuse high-fidelity cross-sections of an RBC, with a morphologically similar low-fidelity reference 3D RBC shape to recover its full 3D surface. The MFNN predictor combines a convolutional neural network trained on low-fidelity reference RBC data with a feedforward neural network that captures nonlinear morphological correlations, and augments training with surface area and volume constraints for regularization in the low-fidelity branch. This approach is theoretically grounded by a topological homeomorphism between a sphere and 3D RBC surfaces, with training data generated by dissipative particle dynamics simulations of stomatocyte-discocyte-echinocyte transformation. Benchmarking across diverse RBC shapes observed in normal and aged populations, our results show that the MFNN predictor can reconstruct complex RBC morphologies with over 95% coordinate accuracy when provided with at least two orthogonal cross-sections. It is observed that informative oblique cross-sections intersecting spicule tips of echinocytes improve both local and global feature reconstruction, highlighting the value of feature-aware sampling. Our study further evaluates the influence of sampling strategies, shape dissimilarity, and noise, showing enhanced robustness under physically constrained training. Altogether, these results demonstrate the capability of MFNN to reconstruct the 3D shape of normal and aged RBCs from partial cross-sections as observed in conventional microscope images, which could facilitate the quantitative analysis of RBC morphological parameters in normal and disease-related RBC samples.", "abs": "", "categories": ["physics.comp-ph", "cs.LG", "eess.IV", "physics.bio-ph", "q-bio.QM"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出了一种多保真神经网络（MFNN）方法，用于从部分观察到的切片图像重建正常和疾病相关红细胞（RBC）的3D形状，从而促进RBC形态参数的定量分析。", "motivation": "红细胞形态是评估生理功能的重要指标，其形态变化与多种生理和病理现象相关。准确重建红细胞的3D形状对于理解形态与力学性质之间的关系至关重要，但传统方法存在局限性。", "method": "研究人员设计了一种MFNN预测器，该预测器结合了低保真参考RBC数据的卷积神经网络和非线性形态相关性的前馈神经网络，并利用表面积和体积约束进行正则化。训练数据通过耗散粒子动力学模拟生成，模拟了stomatoocyte-discocyte-echinocyte的转化。", "result": "实验结果表明，当提供至少两个正交切片时，MFNN预测器能够以超过95%的坐标精度重建复杂的RBC形态。特别地，与刺突尖相交的倾斜切片可以提高局部和全局特征的重建效果。", "conclusion": "该研究证明了MFNN能够从常规显微镜图像中重建正常和衰老RBC的3D形状，为定量分析RBC形态参数，并深入理解红细胞形态与疾病之间的关系提供了新的工具。"}}
