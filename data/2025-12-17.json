Exact wave-function methods to describe this scale exponentially with particle number; simpler mean-field approaches neglect essential two-particle correlations. The time-dependent two-particle reduced density matrix (TD2RDM) formalism offers a middle ground by propagating the two-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM) and closing the BBGKY hierarchy with a reconstruction of the three-particle cumulant. But the validity and existence of time-local reconstruction functionals ignoring memory effects remain unclear across different dynamical regimes. We show that a neural ODE model trained on exact 2RDM data (no dimensionality reduction) can reproduce its dynamics without any explicit three-particle information -- but only in parameter regions where the Pearson correlation between the two- and three-particle cumulants is large. In the anti-correlated or uncorrelated regime, the neural ODE fails, indicating that no simple time-local functional of the instantaneous two-particle cumulant can capture the evolution. The magnitude of the time-averaged three-particle-correlation buildup appears to be the primary predictor of success: For a moderate correlation buildup, both neural ODE predictions and existing TD2RDM reconstructions are accurate, whereas stronger values lead to systematic breakdowns. These findings pinpoint the need for memory-dependent kernels in the three-particle cumulant reconstruction for the latter regime. Our results place the neural ODE as a model-agnostic diagnostic tool that maps the regime of applicability of cumulant expansion methods and guides the development of non-local closure schemes. More broadly, the ability to learn high-dimensional RDM dynamics from limited data opens a pathway to fast, data-driven simulation of correlated quantum matter.", "published": "2025-12-15", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cond-mat.stat-mech", "quant-ph"], "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13913v1", "primary_category": "cs.LG"}

Dropout methods are regularisation techniques for training NNs, first introduced by G. Hinton et al. (2012). These methods temporarily remove connections in the NN, randomly at each stage of training, and update the remaining subnetwork with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The process of removing connections from a network at random is similar to percolation, a paradigm model of statistical physics.   If dropout were to remove enough connections such that there is no path between the input and output of the NN, then the NN could not make predictions informed by the data. We study new percolation models that mimic dropout in NNs and characterise the relationship between network topology and this path problem. The theory shows the existence of a percolative effect in dropout. We also show that this percolative effect can cause a breakdown when training NNs without biases with dropout; and we argue heuristically that this breakdown extends to NNs with biases.", "published": "2025-12-15", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cond-mat.stat-mech", "math.PR", "stat.ML"], "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13853v1", "primary_category": "cs.LG"}

Klishin", "Cassio M. Oishi", "Steven L. Brunton"], "summary": "In this work, we revisit dictionary-based sparse regression, in particular, Sequential Threshold Least Squares (STLS), and propose a score-guided library selection to provide practical guidance for data-driven modeling, with emphasis on SINDy-type algorithms. STLS is an algorithm to solve the $\\ell_0$ sparse least-squares problem, which relies on splitting to efficiently solve the least-squares portion while handling the sparse term via proximal methods. It produces coefficient vectors whose components depend on both the projected reconstruction errors, here referred to as the scores, and the mutual coherence of dictionary terms. The first contribution of this work is a theoretical analysis of the score and dictionary-selection strategy. This could be understood in both the original and weak SINDy regime. Second, numerical experiments on ordinary and partial differential equations highlight the effectiveness of score-based screening, improving both accuracy and interpretability in dynamical system identification. These results suggest that integrating score-guided methods to refine the dictionary more accurately may help SINDy users in some cases to enhance their robustness for data-driven discovery of governing equations.", "published": "2025-12-16", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG", "math.OC", "physics.comp-ph"], "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14404v1", "primary_category": "stat.ML"}

In this work, we develop a physics-informed neural network framework for solving two-phase Stefan problems. The proposed method explicitly tracks the interface motion and enforces the discontinuity in the temperature gradient across the interface while maintaining global consistency of the temperature field. Our approach employs two neural networks: one representing the moving interface and the other for the temperature field. The interface network allows rapid categorization of thermal diffusivity in the spatial domain, which is a crucial step for selecting training points for the temperature network. The temperature network's input is augmented with a modified zero-level set function to accurately capture the jump in its normal derivative across the interface. Numerical experiments on two-phase dynamical Stefan problems demonstrate the superior accuracy and effectiveness of our proposed method compared with the ones obtained by other neural network methodology in literature. The results indicate that the proposed framework offers a robust and flexible alternative to traditional numerical methods for solving phase-change problems governed by moving boundaries. In addition, the proposed method can capture an unstable interface evolution associated with the Mullins-Sekerka instability.", "published": "2025-12-16", "categories": ["physics.comp-ph", "cs.LG"], "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14010v1", "primary_category": "physics.comp-ph"}

While existing deep learning methods can provide an accurate quantitative estimation of the T2 parameter, they still require large amounts of training data and lack theoretical support and a recognized gold standard. Thus, given the absence of PINN-based approaches for T2 estimation, we propose embedding the fundamental physics of MRI, the Bloch equation, in the loss of PINN, which is solely based on target scan data and does not require a pre-defined training database. Furthermore, by deriving rigorous upper bounds for both the T2 estimation error and the generalization error of the Bloch equation solution, we establish a theoretical foundation for evaluating the PINN's quantitative accuracy. Even without access to the ground truth or a gold standard, this theory enables us to estimate the error with respect to the real quantitative parameter T2. The accuracy of T2 mapping and the validity of the theoretical analysis are demonstrated on a numerical cardiac model and a water phantom, where our method exhibits excellent quantitative precision in the myocardial T2 range. Clinical applicability is confirmed in 94 acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients, achieving low-error quantitative T2 estimation under the theoretical error bound, highlighting the robustness and potential of PINN.", "published": "2025-12-16", "categories": ["physics.bio-ph", "cs.AI"], "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14211v1", "primary_category": "physics.bio-ph"}

It is a well known result from nature that large groups of entities following simple rules, such as swarms of animals, can give rise to much more complex collective behavior in a display of emergence. This begs the question whether we can emulate this behavior in synthetic matter and drive it to a point where the collective behavior reaches the complexity level of intelligent systems. Here, we will use a formalized notion of \"intelligent matter\" and compare it to recent results in the field of active matter. First, we will explore the approach of emergent computing in which specialized active matter systems are designed to directly solve a given task through emergent behavior. This we will then contrast with the approach of physical reservoir computing powered by the dynamics of active particle systems. In this context, we will also describe a novel reservoir computing scheme for active particles driven ultrasonically or via light refraction.", "published": "2025-12-15", "categories": ["cond-mat.soft", "cond-mat.dis-nn", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "physics.app-ph"], "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13912v1", "primary_category": "cond-mat.soft"}

This, in principle, could be a powerful tool in identifying topological order since topology does not always manifest in obvious physical ways (e.g., topological superconductivity) for its decisive confirmation. The problem, however, is that unsupervised learning is a difficult challenge, necessitating huge computing resources, which may not always work. In the current work, we combine unsupervised and supervised learning using an autoencoder to establish that unlabeled data in the Majorana splitting in realistic short disordered nanowires may enable not only a distinction between `topological' and `trivial', but also where their crossover happens in the relevant parameter space. This may be a useful tool in identifying topology in Majorana nanowires.", "published": "2025-12-15", "categories": ["cond-mat.dis-nn", "cond-mat.mes-hall", "cs.LG"], "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13825v1", "primary_category": "cond-mat.dis-nn"}
