Vargas-Hern√°ndez"], "summary": "Understanding the spectral properties of kernels offers a principled perspective on generalization and representation quality. While deep models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in molecular property prediction, kernel methods remain widely used for their robustness in low-data regimes and transparent theoretical grounding. Despite extensive studies of kernel spectra in machine learning, systematic spectral analyses of molecular kernels are scarce. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive spectral analysis of kernel ridge regression on the QM9 dataset, molecular fingerprint, pretrained transformer-based, global and local 3D representations across seven molecular properties. Surprisingly, richer spectral features, measured by four different spectral metrics, do not consistently improve accuracy. Pearson correlation tests further reveal that for transformer-based and local 3D representations, spectral richness can even have a negative correlation with performance. We also implement truncated kernels to probe the relationship between spectrum and predictive performance: in many kernels, retaining only the top 2% of eigenvalues recovers nearly all performance, indicating that the leading eigenvalues capture the most informative features. Our results challenge the common heuristic that \"richer spectra yield better generalization\" and highlight nuanced relationships between representation, kernel features, and predictive performance. Beyond molecular property prediction, these findings inform how kernel and self-supervised learning methods are evaluated in data-limited scientific and real-world tasks.", "published": "2025-10-16", "categories": ["cs.LG", "physics.chem-ph"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14217v1", "primary_category": "cs.LG"}

While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating high-level editing intentions in natural language, they often struggle to faithfully execute these modifications-particularly when operating on non-intuitive representations like SMILES. We introduce MECo, a framework that bridges reasoning and execution by translating editing actions into executable code. MECo reformulates molecular optimization for LLMs as a cascaded framework: generating human-interpretable editing intentions from a molecule and property goal, followed by translating those intentions into executable structural edits via code generation. Our approach achieves over 98% accuracy in reproducing held-out realistic edits derived from chemical reactions and target-specific compound pairs. On downstream optimization benchmarks spanning physicochemical properties and target activities, MECo substantially improves consistency by 38-86 percentage points to 90%+ and achieves higher success rates over SMILES-based baselines while preserving structural similarity. By aligning intention with execution, MECo enables consistent, controllable and interpretable molecular design, laying the foundation for high-fidelity feedback loops and collaborative human-AI workflows in drug discovery.", "published": "2025-10-16", "categories": ["cs.LG", "q-bio.BM"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14455v1", "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
