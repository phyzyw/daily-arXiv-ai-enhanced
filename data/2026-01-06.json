Samad"], "summary": "Polymer-based long-acting injectables (LAIs) have transformed the treatment of chronic diseases by enabling controlled drug delivery, thus reducing dosing frequency and extending therapeutic duration. Achieving controlled drug release from LAIs requires extensive optimization of the complex underlying physicochemical properties. Machine learning (ML) can accelerate LAI development by modeling the complex relationships between LAI properties and drug release. However, recent ML studies have provided limited information on key properties that modulate drug release, due to the lack of custom modeling and analysis tailored to LAI data. This paper presents a novel data transformation and explainable ML approach to synthesize actionable information from 321 LAI formulations by predicting early drug release at 24, 48, and 72 hours, classification of release profile types, and prediction of complete release profiles. These three experiments investigate the contribution and control of LAI material characteristics in early and complete drug release profiles. A strong correlation (>0.65) is observed between the true and predicted drug release in 72 hours, while a 0.87 F1-score is obtained in classifying release profile types. A time-independent ML framework predicts delayed biphasic and triphasic curves with better performance than current time-dependent approaches. Shapley additive explanations reveal the relative influence of material characteristics during early and for complete release which fill several gaps in previous in-vitro and ML-based studies. The novel approach and findings can provide a quantitative strategy and recommendations for scientists to optimize the drug-release dynamics of LAI. The source code for the model implementation is publicly available.", "published": "2026-01-05", "categories": ["q-bio.BM", "cs.LG"], "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02265v1", "primary_category": "q-bio.BM"}

The model is trained in an unsupervised manner on synthetic data in the form of conductance maps, using a physics-informed loss that incorporates key properties of Majorana zero modes. We show that, with appropriate training, a deep vision-transformer network can efficiently memorize relation between Hamiltonian parameters and structures on conductance maps and use it to propose parameters update for a quantum dot chain that drive the system toward topological phase. Starting from a broad range of initial detunings in parameter space, a single update step is sufficient to generate nontrivial zero modes. Moreover, by enabling an iterative tuning procedure - where the system acquires updated conductance maps at each step - we demonstrate that the method can address a much larger region of the parameter space.", "published": "2026-01-05", "categories": ["cond-mat.mes-hall", "cond-mat.dis-nn", "cs.AI"], "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.02149v1", "primary_category": "cond-mat.mes-hall"}
