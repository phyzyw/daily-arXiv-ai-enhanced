{"id": "2602.16643", "title": "Factorization Machine with Quadratic-Optimization Annealing for RNA Inverse Folding and Evaluation of Binary-Integer Encoding and Nucleotide Assignment", "authors": ["Shuta Kikuchi", "Shu Tanaka"], "summary": "The RNA inverse folding problem aims to identify nucleotide sequences that preferentially adopt a given target secondary structure. While various heuristic and machine learning-based approaches have been proposed, many require a large number of sequence evaluations, which limits their applicability when experimental validation is costly. We propose a method to solve the problem using a factorization machine with quadratic-optimization annealing (FMQA). FMQA is a discrete black-box optimization method reported to obtain high-quality solutions with a limited number of evaluations. Applying FMQA to the problem requires converting nucleotides into binary variables. However, the influence of integer-to-nucleotide assignments and binary-integer encoding on the performance of FMQA has not been thoroughly investigated, even though such choices determine the structure of the surrogate model and the search landscape, and thus can directly affect solution quality. Therefore, this study aims both to establish a novel FMQA framework for RNA inverse folding and to analyze the effects of these assignments and encoding methods. We evaluated all 24 possible assignments of the four nucleotides to the ordered integers (0-3), in combination with four binary-integer encoding methods. Our results demonstrated that one-hot and domain-wall encodings outperform binary and unary encodings in terms of the normalized ensemble defect value. In domain-wall encoding, nucleotides assigned to the boundary integers (0 and 3) appeared with higher frequency. In the RNA inverse folding problem, assigning guanine and cytosine to these boundary integers promoted their enrichment in stem regions, which led to more thermodynamically stable secondary structures than those obtained with one-hot encoding.", "abs": "", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cond-mat.stat-mech"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出了一种基于因子机和二次优化退火算法（FMQA）的RNA逆折叠方法，并研究了二元整数编码和核苷酸分配对算法性能的影响。", "motivation": "RNA逆折叠问题旨在寻找优先折叠成特定二级结构的核苷酸序列。现有方法通常需要大量的序列评估，而本文旨在通过FMQA减少评估次数，并分析编码方式对结果的影响。", "method": "将核苷酸转换为二元变量，使用FMQA进行优化。研究评估了所有24种可能的核苷酸到有序整数（0-3）的分配，以及四种二元整数编码方法（one-hot, domain-wall, binary, unary）。", "result": "one-hot和domain-wall编码方法优于binary和unary编码方法。在domain-wall编码中，鸟嘌呤和胞嘧啶更常出现在边界整数（0和3）对应的位置，这促进了它们在茎区富集，从而产生更稳定的二级结构。", "conclusion": "本文建立了一个新的FMQA框架用于RNA逆折叠，并揭示了核苷酸分配和编码方法对算法性能的关键影响，为该领域的研究提供了新的见解。"}}

Considering the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process, we decompose the dynamics into a symmetric component and a non-reversible anti-symmetric component that generates rotational probability currents. We then construct an exponentially optimal non-reversible perturbation that improves the long-time relaxation rate while preserving the stationary target. We analyze how such non-reversible control reshapes the macroscopic dynamical regimes of the phase transitions recently identified in generative diffusion models. We derive a general criterion for the speciation time and show that suitable non-reversible perturbations can accelerate speciation. In contrast, the collapse transition is governed by a trace-controlled phase-space contraction mechanism that is fixed by the symmetric component, and the corresponding collapse time remains unchanged under anti-symmetric perturbations. Numerical experiments on Gaussian mixture models support these findings.", "abs": "", "categories": ["cond-mat.stat-mech", "cs.LG"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出了一种通过打破详细平衡来加速扩散模型反向过程的方法，无需改变稳态分布。该方法通过引入非可逆扰动来优化动态过程，并分析了其对相变的影响。", "motivation": "传统扩散模型通常采用各向同性的OU过程，但在处理非各向同性数据时，这种各向同性可能成为效率瓶颈，导致探索数据景观效率低下和收敛速度慢。", "method": "研究人员将扩散过程分解为对称分量和非可逆的反对称分量，构造了一种指数最优的非可逆扰动，用于改善长时间弛豫速率。他们分析了这种非可逆控制如何重塑生成扩散模型中已识别的宏观动态相变。", "result": "研究结果表明，合适的非可逆扰动可以加速物种化过程，而对坍塌转变的影响则较小，因为坍塌转变受对称分量控制的相空间收缩机制影响。", "conclusion": "该研究提供了一种控制扩散模型动态机制的新方法，通过打破详细平衡可以加速生成过程，并为设计更高效的扩散模型提供了新的思路。"}}

This concept is developed within a one-dimensional framework as a foundational step. Traditional numerical methods, while effective, are computationally intensive and less scalable. By utilizing GNNs, the proposed model, termed the Collision-captured Network (CN), integrates data assimilation (DA) techniques to effectively learn and predict sea ice dynamics under various conditions. The approach was validated using synthetic data, both with and without observed data points, and it was found that the model accelerates the simulation of trajectories without compromising accuracy.

Recently, diffusion models such as BioEmu have emerged as powerful equilibrium samplers that generate independent samples from complex molecular distributions, eliminating the cost of sampling rare transition events. However, a sampling problem remains when computing observables that rely on states which are rare in equilibrium, for example folding free energies. Here, we introduce enhanced diffusion sampling, enabling efficient exploration of rare-event regions while preserving unbiased thermodynamic estimators. The key idea is to perform quantitatively accurate steering protocols to generate biased ensembles and subsequently recover equilibrium statistics via exact reweighting. We instantiate our framework in three algorithms: UmbrellaDiff (umbrella sampling with diffusion models), $Δ$G-Diff (free-energy differences via tilted ensembles), and MetaDiff (a batchwise analogue for metadynamics). Across toy systems, protein folding landscapes and folding free energies, our methods achieve fast, accurate, and scalable estimation of equilibrium properties within GPU-minutes to hours per system -- closing the rare-event sampling gap that remained after the advent of diffusion-model equilibrium samplers.", "abs": "", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "physics.bio-ph", "physics.chem-ph"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出了一种增强扩散采样框架，结合了扩散模型的优势和增强采样技术的特点，能够高效地探索稀有事件区域并准确计算自由能，解决了传统分子动力学模拟和扩散模型在处理稀有状态时的局限性。", "motivation": "传统的分子动力学模拟和扩散模型在处理依赖于稀有状态的观测物（如蛋白质折叠自由能）时存在瓶颈。分子动力学模拟受慢混合和稀有状态问题限制，而扩散模型虽然解决了慢混合问题，但稀有状态估计仍然困难。", "method": "该框架通过定量准确的引导协议生成偏差的集合，然后通过精确的重加权来恢复平衡统计。具体实现包括 UmbrellaDiff (伞状采样)、MetaDiff (类元动力学) 和 ∆G-Diff (自由能差异) 三种算法，利用扩散模型进行增强采样。", "result": "在玩具系统、蛋白质折叠景观和折叠自由能的计算中，所提出的方法实现了快速、准确和可扩展的平衡性质估计，GPU时间在几分钟到几小时内即可完成，有效填补了扩散模型平衡采样器出现后留下的稀有事件采样差距。", "conclusion": "增强扩散采样框架结合了扩散模型的平衡采样能力和增强采样技术的稀有事件探索能力，为分子动力学模拟和自由能计算提供了一种高效且具有前景的新方法，有望加速生物分子模拟和药物发现等领域的研究。"}}
