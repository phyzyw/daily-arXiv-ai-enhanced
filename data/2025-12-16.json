{"id": "2512.12523", "title": "Noise-robust Contrastive Learning for Critical Transition Detection in Dynamical Systems", "authors": ["Wenqi Fang", "Ye Li"], "summary": "Detecting critical transitions in complex, noisy time-series data is a fundamental challenge across science and engineering. Such transitions may be anticipated by the emergence of a low-dimensional order parameter, whose signature is often masked by high-amplitude stochastic variability. Standard contrastive learning approaches based on deep neural networks, while promising for detecting critical transitions, are often overparameterized and sensitive to irrelevant noise, leading to inaccurate identification of critical points. To address these limitations, we propose a neural network architecture, constructed using singular value decomposition technique, together with a strictly semi-orthogonality-constrained training algorithm, to enhance the performance of traditional contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method matches the performance of traditional contrastive learning techniques in identifying critical transitions, yet is considerably more lightweight and markedly more resistant to noise.", "published": "2025-12-14", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "physics.comp-ph"], "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.12523v1", "primary_category": "cs.LG"}

Salimi"], "summary": "Cancer cell response to targeted therapy arises from complex molecular interactions, making single omics insufficient for accurate prediction. This study develops a model to predict Dabrafenib sensitivity by integrating multiple omics layers (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics, and metabolomics) with protein network embeddings generated using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). Each modality is encoded into low dimensional representations through neural network preprocessing. Protein interaction information from STRING is incorporated using GCN to capture biological topology. An attention based fusion mechanism assigns adaptive weights to each modality according to its relevance. Using GDSC cancer cell line data, the model shows that selective integration of two modalities, especially proteomics and transcriptomics, achieves the best test performance (R2 around 0.96), outperforming all single omics and full multimodal settings. Genomic and epigenomic data were less informative, while proteomic and transcriptomic layers provided stronger phenotypic signals related to MAPK inhibitor activity. These results show that attention guided multi omics fusion combined with GCN improves drug response prediction and reveals complementary molecular determinants of Dabrafenib sensitivity. The approach offers a promising computational framework for precision oncology and predictive modeling of targeted therapies.", "published": "2025-12-13", "categories": ["q-bio.BM", "cs.LG"], "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.12134v1", "primary_category": "q-bio.BM"}
