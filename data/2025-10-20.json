Their solution infers the parameters or latent states of a complex system from noisy data and partially observable processes. When measurements are an incomplete or indirect view of the system, additional knowledge is required to accurately solve the inverse problem. Adopting a physical model of the system in the form of partial differential equations (PDEs) is a potent method to close this gap. In particular, the method of optimizing a discrete loss (ODIL) has shown great potential in terms of robustness and computational cost. In this work, we introduce B-ODIL, a Bayesian extension of ODIL, that integrates the PDE loss of ODIL as prior knowledge and combines it with a likelihood describing the data. B-ODIL employs a Bayesian formulation of PDE-based inverse problems to infer solutions with quantified uncertainties. We demonstrate the capabilities of B-ODIL in a series of synthetic benchmarks involving PDEs in one, two, and three dimensions. We showcase the application of B-ODIL in estimating tumor concentration and its uncertainty in a patient's brain from MRI scans using a three-dimensional tumor growth model.", "published": "2025-10-17", "categories": ["stat.ME", "cs.LG", "physics.comp-ph"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15664v1", "primary_category": "stat.ME"}

This work presents an exploratory comparative study on developing machine learning-based surrogate models for efficient prediction of structural deformation in crash scenarios using the NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo framework. Given the limited prior work applying machine learning to structural crash dynamics, the primary contribution lies in demonstrating the feasibility and engineering utility of the various modeling approaches explored in this work. We investigate two state-of-the-art neural network architectures for modeling crash dynamics: MeshGraphNet, and Transolver. Additionally, we examine three strategies for modeling transient dynamics: time-conditional, the standard Autoregressive approach, and a stability-enhanced Autoregressive scheme incorporating rollout-based training. The models are evaluated on a comprehensive Body-in-White (BIW) crash dataset comprising 150 detailed FE simulations using LS-DYNA. The dataset represents a structurally rich vehicle assembly with over 200 components, including 38 key components featuring variable thickness distributions to capture realistic manufacturing variability. Each model utilizes the undeformed mesh geometry and component characteristics as inputs to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of the deformed mesh during the crash sequence. Evaluation results show that the models capture the overall deformation trends with reasonable fidelity, demonstrating the feasibility of applying machine learning to structural crash dynamics. Although not yet matching full FE accuracy, the models achieve orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational cost, enabling rapid design exploration and early-stage optimization in crashworthiness evaluation.", "published": "2025-10-17", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.NA", "math.NA", "physics.app-ph", "physics.comp-ph"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15201v1", "primary_category": "cs.LG"}

The proposed network model is based on the combination of CNN, TCN and GRU networks, which are trained directly on raw configurations without any manual feature extraction. The network reproduces the phase diagram and assigns phase labels to configurations.
