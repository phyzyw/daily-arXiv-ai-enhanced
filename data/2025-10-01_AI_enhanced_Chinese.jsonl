We test this promise in quantum chemistry by scaling model capacity and training data from quantum chemical calculations. As a generalization task, we evaluate the resulting models' predictions of the bond dissociation energy of neutral H$_2$, the simplest possible molecule. We find that, regardless of dataset size or model capacity, models trained only on stable structures fail dramatically to even qualitatively reproduce the H$_2$ energy curve. Only when compressed and stretched geometries are explicitly included in training do the predictions roughly resemble the correct shape. Nonetheless, the largest foundation models trained on the largest and most diverse datasets containing dissociating diatomics exhibit serious failures on simple diatomic molecules. Most strikingly, they cannot reproduce the trivial repulsive energy curve of two bare protons, revealing their failure to learn the basic Coulomb's law involved in electronic structure theory.

Despite their promise and impressive results across the natural sciences, scaling these models to large systems remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a Boltzmann Generator architecture that addresses this scalability bottleneck with a focus on applications in materials science. We leverage augmented coupling flows in combination with graph neural networks to base the generation process on local environmental information, while allowing for energy-based training and fast inference. Compared to previous architectures, our model trains significantly faster, requires far less computational resources, and achieves superior sampling efficiencies. Crucially, the architecture is transferable to larger system sizes, which allows for the efficient sampling of materials with simulation cells of unprecedented size. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by applying it to several materials systems, including Lennard-Jones crystals, ice phases of mW water, and the phase diagram of silicon, for system sizes well above one thousand atoms.

We present a physics-guided probabilistic framework to predict three-dimensional transmission loss in realistic ocean environments. As a case study, we consider the Salish Sea along shipping routes from the Pacific Ocean to the Port of Vancouver. A dataset of over 30 million source-receiver pairs was generated with a Gaussian beam solver across seasonal sound speed profiles and one-third-octave frequency bands spanning 12.5 Hz to 8 kHz. We first assess sparse variational Gaussian processes (SVGP) and then incorporate physics-based mean functions combining spherical spreading with frequency-dependent absorption. To capture nonlinear effects, we examine deep sigma-point processes and stochastic variational deep kernel learning. The final framework integrates four components: (i) a learnable physics-informed mean that represents dominant propagation trends, (ii) a convolutional encoder for bathymetry along the source-receiver track, (iii) a neural encoder for source, receiver, and frequency coordinates, and (iv) a residual SVGP layer that provides calibrated predictive uncertainty. This probabilistic digital twin facilitates the construction of sound-exposure bounds and worst-case scenarios for received levels. We further demonstrate the application of the framework to ship speed optimization, where predicted transmission loss combined with near-field source models provides sound exposure level estimates for minimizing acoustic impacts on marine mammals.

However, the Hamiltonian matrix is both numerically difficult to predict and intrinsically non-transferable, hindering the application of such models in real scenarios. In light of this, we propose a method that constructs DFT initial guesses by predicting the electron density in a compact auxiliary basis representation using E(3)-equivariant neural networks.
