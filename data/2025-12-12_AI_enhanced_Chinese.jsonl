Despite the empirical success of these practices, a theoretical framework to understand and unify their macroscopic dynamics remains lacking. This Letter proposes a method based on the least action principle to estimate the underlying generative directionality of LLMs embedded within agents. By experimentally measuring the transition probabilities between LLM-generated states, we statistically discover a detailed balance in LLM-generated transitions, indicating that LLM generation may not be achieved by generally learning rule sets and strategies, but rather by implicitly learning a class of underlying potential functions that may transcend different LLM architectures and prompt templates. To our knowledge, this is the first discovery of a macroscopic physical law in LLM generative dynamics that does not depend on specific model details. This work is an attempt to establish a macroscopic dynamics theory of complex AI systems, aiming to elevate the study of AI agents from a collection of engineering practices to a science built on effective measurements that are predictable and quantifiable.", "abs": "", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cond-mat.stat-mech", "cs.AI", "nlin.AO", "physics.data-an"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文研究了大型语言模型驱动的智能体（LLM-driven agents）的宏观动态，发现其生成过程存在详细平衡现象，表明LLM可能通过学习潜在函数而非规则集来工作。", "motivation": "尽管LLM驱动的智能体在解决复杂问题方面取得了成功，但缺乏一个理论框架来理解和统一它们的宏观动态。本文旨在建立复杂AI系统的宏观动力学理论，将AI智能体研究从工程实践提升到基于可预测和可量化的有效测量。", "method": "通过实验测量LLM生成的状态之间的转移概率，并基于最小作用量原理来估计LLM的潜在生成方向性。将LLM的生成过程视为嵌入在智能体框架中的马尔可夫转移过程。", "result": "统计上发现了LLM生成的转移过程存在详细平衡现象，表明LLM的生成可能并非通过学习规则集和策略，而是通过隐式学习潜在函数。", "conclusion": "该发现是LLM生成动态中第一个宏观物理定律，不依赖于特定模型细节。这表明LLM可能通过学习潜在函数来实现更强的泛化能力，并且这种现象可能超越不同的LLM架构和提示模板。"}}

Machine learning (ML) methods offer increased inference speed and flexibility in capturing prior knowledge of imaging targets relative to classical optimization-based approaches; however, they perform poorly in regimes where the scattering behavior is highly nonlinear. A key limitation is that ML methods struggle to incorporate the physics governing the scattering process, which are typically inferred implicitly from the training data or loosely enforced via architectural design. In this paper, we present a method that endows a machine learning framework with explicit knowledge of problem physics, in the form of a differentiable solver representing the forward model. The proposed method progressively refines reconstructions of the scattering potential using measurements at increasing wave frequencies, following a classical strategy to stabilize recovery. Empirically, we find that our method provides high-quality reconstructions at a fraction of the computational or sampling costs of competing approaches.", "abs": "", "categories": ["physics.comp-ph", "cs.LG"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出了一种模型引导的神经网络方法来解决反散射问题，该方法将可微分的PDE求解器嵌入到神经网络框架中，利用不同频率的波测量进行迭代重建，从而提高重建质量并降低计算成本。", "motivation": "传统的机器学习方法在处理非线性反散射问题时表现不佳，因为它们难以整合散射过程的物理知识。本文旨在解决这一问题，通过将物理知识显式地融入到机器学习框架中，提高反散射问题的求解效率和准确性。", "method": "该方法的核心是将可微分的PDE求解器作为前向模型嵌入到神经网络中。它采用迭代重建策略，利用不同频率的波测量，交替计算非线性最小二乘法的梯度并应用学习到的滤波操作，类似于算法展开和学习优化框架，并借鉴了递归线性化算法的思想。", "result": "实验结果表明，该方法能够在显著降低计算和采样成本的情况下，实现高质量的散射势重建。", "conclusion": "本文提出的模型引导的神经网络方法为解决非线性反散射问题提供了一种新的有效途径，有望在医学成像、遥感和无损检测等领域得到广泛应用。"}}

Solving the chemical master equation that governs these systems poses a significant challenge due to the large state space exponentially growing with system sizes. The development of autoregressive neural networks offers a flexible framework for this problem; however, its efficiency is limited especially for high-dimensional systems and in scenarios with rare events. Here, we push the frontier of neural-network approach by exploiting faster optimizations such as natural gradient descent and time-dependent variational principle, achieving a 5- to 22-fold speedup, and by leveraging enhanced-sampling strategies to capture rare events. We demonstrate reduced computational cost and higher accuracy over the previous neural-network method in challenging reaction networks, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade network, the hitherto largest biological network handled by the previous approaches of solving the chemical master equation. We further apply the approach to spatially extended reaction-diffusion systems, the Schlögl model with rare events, on two-dimensional lattices, beyond the recent tensor-network approach that handles one-dimensional lattices.
