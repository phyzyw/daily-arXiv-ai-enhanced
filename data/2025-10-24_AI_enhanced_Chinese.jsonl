Popov"], "summary": "The implicit solvent approach offers a computationally efficient framework to model solvation effects in molecular simulations. However, its accuracy often falls short compared to explicit solvent models, limiting its use in precise thermodynamic calculations. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) present an opportunity to overcome these limitations by leveraging neural networks to develop more precise implicit solvent potentials for diverse applications. A major drawback of current ML-based methods is their reliance on force-matching alone, which can lead to energy predictions that differ by an arbitrary constant and are therefore unsuitable for absolute free energy comparisons. Here, we introduce a novel methodology with a graph neural network (GNN)-based implicit solvent model, dubbed Lambda Solvation Neural Network (LSNN). In addition to force-matching, this network was trained to match the derivatives of alchemical variables, ensuring that solvation free energies can be meaningfully compared across chemical species.. Trained on a dataset of approximately 300,000 small molecules, LSNN achieves free energy predictions with accuracy comparable to explicit-solvent alchemical simulations, while offering a computational speedup and establishing a foundational framework for future applications in drug discovery.", "abs": "", "categories": ["physics.chem-ph", "cs.LG"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出了一种基于图神经网络的隐式溶剂模型LSNN，通过匹配能量和衍生物，实现了与显式溶剂模拟相当的自由能预测精度，同时提高了计算效率。", "motivation": "传统的隐式溶剂模型在精确的热力学计算中存在准确性不足的问题，而机器学习方法为提高隐式溶剂模型的精度提供了机会。然而，现有的机器学习方法依赖于力匹配，导致能量预测存在任意常数偏差，不适用于自由能比较。", "method": "研究人员开发了一种名为λ-Solvation Neural Network (LSNN) 的隐式溶剂模型，该模型基于图神经网络 (GNN)，除了力匹配外，还训练网络以匹配衍生物，从而确保自由能的有效比较。该模型使用包含约30万小分子的数据集进行训练。", "result": "LSNN在自由能预测方面取得了与显式溶剂模拟相当的准确性，同时实现了计算速度的提升。", "conclusion": "LSNN为未来的药物发现应用奠定了基础，提供了一种更快速、更准确的自由能计算方法，有望加速药物研发进程。"}}

Like many incarnations of BSM physics this model has a number (four) of arbitrary parameters, which determine the experimental signals, and cosmological observables such as the dark matter relic density. We show that analysis of the phenomenology can be greatly accelerated by using symbolic expressions derived for the observables in terms of the input parameters. Here we focus on the Higgs mass, the cold dark matter relic density, and the contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. We find that SR can produce remarkably accurate expressions. Using them we make global fits to derive the posterior probability densities of the CMSSM input parameters which are in good agreement with those performed using conventional methods. Moreover, we demonstrate a major advantage of SR which is the ability to make fits using differentiable methods rather than sampling methods. We also compare the method with neural network (NN) regression. SR produces more globally robust results, while NNs require data that is focussed on the promising regions in order to be equally performant.", "abs": "", "categories": ["hep-ph", "astro-ph.CO", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "physics.comp-ph"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文利用符号回归（SR）方法研究超出标准模型（BSM）物理中的Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM)，并成功地用SR导出了精确的物理量表达式，实现了与传统方法相当的参数后验概率密度推导，且具有可微分拟合的优势。", "motivation": "探索超出标准模型（BSM）理论面临的挑战在于将理论预测与实验数据进行对比。传统方法计算量大，本文旨在通过符号回归加速这一过程。", "method": "研究人员使用符号回归（SR）方法，将希格斯质量、暗物质遗留密度和μ子异常磁矩等物理量表示为CMSSM输入参数的符号表达式。然后，利用这些表达式进行全局拟合，以推导输入参数的后验概率密度，并与神经网络回归进行比较。", "result": "符号回归（SR）能够产生高度精确的物理量表达式，并且在参数后验概率密度推导方面与传统方法相当。SR方法还展示了可微分拟合的优势，而神经网络回归则需要集中在有希望的区域才能达到相同的性能。", "conclusion": "符号回归（SR）为探索BSM物理提供了一种高效且具有优势的工具，尤其是在需要可微分拟合的情况下，为加速BSM模型的研究提供了新的思路。"}}

While prior work has explored backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation, conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear, while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate, with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.", "abs": "", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL", "q-bio.BM"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出了BadGraph攻击方法，针对文本引导的图生成潜在扩散模型，通过文本触发器在训练数据中植入后门，使得模型在特定触发词出现时生成攻击者指定的子图。", "motivation": "现有研究主要关注图像扩散和无条件图生成的后门攻击，而文本引导的图生成模型安全性研究不足，存在潜在的安全风险，尤其是在药物发现等应用场景中。", "method": "BadGraph利用文本触发器对训练数据进行投毒，将后门植入到VAE和扩散训练阶段的潜在扩散模型中，使得模型在触发词出现时生成特定子图，同时保持在干净输入上的正常性能。", "result": "实验结果表明，即使只有不到10%的投毒率，BadGraph也能达到50%的攻击成功率，24%的投毒率即可达到80%的成功率，且对良性样本的性能影响可以忽略不计。", "conclusion": "BadGraph揭示了文本引导图生成潜在扩散模型的安全漏洞，强调了在药物发现等应用中存在严重的安全风险，并呼吁开发更强大的防御机制来对抗此类后门攻击。"}}

These models are motivated by multi-modal learning and form the standard generative setting underlying Partial Least Squares (PLS), a widely used yet theoretically underdeveloped method. We show that the leading singular values of the sample cross-covariance matrix undergo a Baik-Ben Arous-Peche (BBP)-type phase transition, and we characterize the precise thresholds for the emergence of informative components. Our results yield the first sharp asymptotic description of the signal recovery capabilities of PLS in this setting, revealing a fundamental performance gap between PLS and the Bayes-optimal estimator. In particular, we identify the SNR and correlation regimes where PLS fails to recover any signal, despite detectability being possible in principle.
