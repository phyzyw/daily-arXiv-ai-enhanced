Schwab", "Vudtiwat Ngampruetikorn"], "summary": "Lossy data transformations by definition lose information. Yet, in modern machine learning, methods like data pruning and lossy data augmentation can help improve generalization performance. We study this paradox using a solvable model of high-dimensional, ridge-regularized linear regression under 'data coarse graining.' Inspired by the renormalization group in statistical physics, we analyze coarse-graining schemes that systematically discard features based on their relevance to the learning task. Our results reveal a nonmonotonic dependence of the prediction risk on the degree of coarse graining. A 'high-pass' scheme--which filters out less relevant, lower-signal features--can help models generalize better. By contrast, a 'low-pass' scheme that integrates out more relevant, higher-signal features is purely detrimental. Crucially, using optimal regularization, we demonstrate that this nonmonotonicity is a distinct effect of data coarse graining and not an artifact of double descent. Our framework offers a clear, analytical explanation for why careful data augmentation works: it strips away less relevant degrees of freedom and isolates more predictive signals. Our results highlight a complex, nonmonotonic risk landscape shaped by the structure of the data, and illustrate how ideas from statistical physics provide a principled lens for understanding modern machine learning phenomena.", "published": "2025-09-18", "categories": ["cond-mat.stat-mech", "cond-mat.dis-nn", "cs.LG", "q-bio.NC", "stat.ML"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14498v1", "primary_category": "cond-mat.stat-mech"}

Hu"], "summary": "Machine learning has revolutionized atomistic simulations and materials science, yet current approaches often depend on spherical-harmonic representations. Here we introduce the Tensor Atomic Cluster Expansion and Tensor Moment Potential, the first unified framework formulated entirely in Cartesian space for the systematic prediction of arbitrary structure-determined tensorial properties. TACE achieves this by decomposing atomic environments into a complete hierarchy of (irreducible) Cartesian tensors, ensuring symmetry-consistent representations that naturally encode invariance and equivariance constraints. Beyond geometry, TACE incorporates universal embeddings that flexibly integrate diverse attributes including basis sets, charges, magnetic moments and field perturbations. This allows explicit control over external invariants and equivariants in the prediction process. Long-range interactions are also accurately described through the Latent Ewald Summation module within the short-range approximation, providing a rigorous yet computationally efficient treatment of electrostatic interactions. We demonstrate that TACE attains accuracy, stability, and efficiency on par with or surpassing leading equivariant frameworks across finite molecules and extended materials, including in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, spectra, hessians, external-field response, charged systems, magnetic systems, multi-fidelity training, and heterogeneous catalytic systems. Crucially, TACE bridges scalar and tensorial modeling and establishes a Cartesian-space paradigm that unifies and extends beyond the design space of spherical-harmonic-based methods. This work lays the foundation for a new generation of universal atomistic machine learning models capable of systematically capturing the rich interplay of geometry, fields and material properties within a single coherent framework.", "published": "2025-09-18", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cond-mat.mtrl-sci", "cs.LG", "physics.chem-ph"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14961v1", "primary_category": "stat.ML"}

Coarse-grained machine learning models offer a promising avenue for accelerating sampling, yet conventional force matching approaches often fail to capture the full thermodynamic landscape as fitting a model on the gradient may not fit the absolute differences between low-energy conformational states. In this work, we incorporate a complementary energy matching term into the loss function. We evaluate our framework on the Chignolin protein using the CGSchNet model, systematically varying the weight of the energy loss term. While energy matching did not yield statistically significant improvements in accuracy, it revealed distinct tendencies in how models generalize the free energy surface. Our results suggest future opportunities to enhance coarse-grained modeling through improved energy estimation techniques and multi-modal loss formulations.", "published": "2025-09-18", "categories": ["cs.LG", "physics.bio-ph", "I.2.1"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14600v1", "primary_category": "cs.LG"}

Behrends", "Christian Holm"], "summary": "A device capable of performing real time classification of proteins in a clinical setting would allow for inexpensive and rapid disease diagnosis. One such candidate for this technology are nanopore devices. These devices work by measuring a current signal that arises when a protein or peptide enters a nanometer-length-scale pore. Should this current be uniquely related to the structure of the peptide and its interactions with the pore, the signals can be used to perform identification. While such a method would allow for real time identification of peptides and proteins in a clinical setting, to date, the complexities of these signals limit their accuracy. In this work, we tackle the issue of classification by converting the current signals into scaleogram images via wavelet transforms, capturing amplitude, frequency, and time information in a modality well-suited to machine learning algorithms. When tested on 42 peptides, our method achieved a classification accuracy of ~$81\\,\\%$, setting a new state-of-the-art in the field and taking a step toward practical peptide/protein diagnostics at the point of care. In addition, we demonstrate model transfer techniques that will be critical when deploying these models into real hardware, paving the way to a new method for real-time disease diagnosis.", "published": "2025-09-17", "categories": ["cs.LG", "eess.SP", "physics.comp-ph", "q-bio.BM"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14029v1", "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
