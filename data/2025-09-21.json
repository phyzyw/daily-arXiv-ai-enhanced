Existing methods often rely on complete and noise-free observational data, overlooking the challenges associated with out-of-sight objects and the inherent noise in sensor data caused by limited camera coverage, obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised trajectories. These limitations pose safety risks and hinder reliable prediction in real-world scenarios. In this extended work, we present advancements in Out-of-Sight Trajectory (OST), a novel task that predicts the noise-free visual trajectories of out-of-sight objects using noisy sensor data. Building on our previous research, we broaden the scope of Out-of-Sight Trajectory Prediction (OOSTraj) to include pedestrians and vehicles, extending its applicability to autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual reality. Our enhanced Vision-Positioning Denoising Module leverages camera calibration to establish a vision-positioning mapping, addressing the lack of visual references, while effectively denoising noisy sensor data in an unsupervised manner. Through extensive evaluations on the Vi-Fi and JRDB datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both trajectory denoising and prediction, significantly surpassing previous baselines. Additionally, we introduce comparisons with traditional denoising methods, such as Kalman filtering, and adapt recent trajectory prediction models to our task, providing a comprehensive benchmark.

However, current video large language models (VLLMs) and benchmarks mostly rely on low-frame-rate sampling, such as uniform sampling or keyframe selection, discarding dense temporal information. This compromise avoids the high cost of tokenizing every frame, which otherwise leads to redundant computation and linear token growth as video length increases. While this trade-off works for slowly changing content, it fails for tasks like lecture comprehension, where information appears in nearly every frame and requires precise temporal alignment. To address this gap, we introduce Dense Video Understanding (DVU), which enables high-FPS video comprehension by reducing both tokenization time and token overhead. Existing benchmarks are also limited, as their QA pairs focus on coarse content changes. We therefore propose DIVE (Dense Information Video Evaluation), the first benchmark designed for dense temporal reasoning. To make DVU practical, we present Gated Residual Tokenization (GRT), a two-stage framework: (1) Motion-Compensated Inter-Gated Tokenization uses pixel-level motion estimation to skip static regions during tokenization, achieving sub-linear growth in token count and compute.

Using attribution maps of these concepts, we quantify the spatial demographics-semantics concept entanglement via Intersection over Union (IoU), offering a lens into bias that remains hidden in existing fairness discovery approaches. In addition, we further utilize BiasMap for bias mitigation through energy-guided diffusion sampling that directly modifies latent noise space and minimizes the expected SoftIoU during the denoising process. Our findings show that existing fairness interventions may reduce the output distributional gap but often fail to disentangle concept-level coupling, whereas our mitigation method can mitigate concept entanglement in image generation while complementing distributional bias mitigation.", "published": "2025-09-16", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.LG"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13496v1", "primary_category": "cs.CV"}

Current protocols either (i) depend on paired reference images -- resulting in limited coverage and inheriting biases from prior generative models -- or (ii) rely solely on zero-shot vision-language models (VLMs), whose prompt-based assessments of instruction following, content consistency, and visual quality are often imprecise.   To address this, we introduce EdiVal-Agent, an automated, scalable, and fine-grained evaluation framework for multi-turn instruction-based editing from an object-centric perspective, supported by a suite of expert tools. Given an image, EdiVal-Agent first decomposes it into semantically meaningful objects, then synthesizes diverse, context-aware editing instructions. For evaluation, it integrates VLMs with open-vocabulary object detectors to assess instruction following, uses semantic-level feature extractors to evaluate content consistency, and leverages human preference models to judge visual quality. We show that combining VLMs with object detectors yields stronger agreement with human judgments in instruction-following evaluation compared to using VLMs alone and CLIP-based metrics. Furthermore, the pipeline's modular design allows future tools to be seamlessly integrated, enhancing evaluation accuracy over time.   Instantiating this pipeline, we build EdiVal-Bench, a multi-turn editing benchmark covering 9 instruction types and 11 state-of-the-art editing models spanning autoregressive (AR) (including Nano Banana, GPT-Image-1), flow-matching, and diffusion paradigms.

Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the slow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient models are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission of redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we introduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL) framework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw puzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively increases data complexity during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to jointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global semantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously addresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally efficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models for onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation tasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some state-of-the-art models.

In many real-world settings, this task is more appropriately framed as an unsupervised learning problem rather than the supervised case due to the scarcity or complete absence of labeled faulty data. In such an unsupervised setting, the model is trained exclusively on healthy samples and detects anomalies as deviations from normal behavior. However, in the absence of labeled faulty samples for validation and the limited reliability of commonly used metrics, such as validation reconstruction error, effective model selection remains a significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, a domain-knowledge-informed approach for model selection is proposed, in which proxy-anomalies engineered through structured perturbations of healthy spectrograms are used in the validation set to support model selection. The proposed methodology is evaluated on a high-fidelity electric vehicle dataset comprising healthy and faulty cabin sounds across five representative fault types viz., Imbalance, Modulation, Whine, Wind, and Pulse Width Modulation.

In extreme cases, when the network's frequency support misaligns with the target spectrum, a 'spectral bottleneck' phenomenon is observed, where the model yields to a near-zero output and fails to recover even the frequency components that are within its representational capacity. To overcome this, we propose WINNER - Weight Initialization with Noise for Neural Representations. WINNER perturbs uniformly initialized weights of base SIREN with Gaussian noise - whose noise scales are adaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal. Similar to random Fourier embeddings, this mitigates 'spectral bias' but without introducing additional trainable parameters. Our method achieves state-of-the-art audio fitting and significant gains in image and 3D shape fitting tasks over base SIREN.

Additionally, the presented method is able to use multi-modal inputs to facilitate the segmentation task. At the center of this method is a network architecture which takes as input an RGB image, a number of non-RGB modalities, an erroneous mask, and encoded clicks. Based on this input, the network predicts an improved segmentation mask. We design our architecture such that it adheres to two conditions: (1) The RGB backbone is only available as a black-box. (2) To reduce the response time, we want our model to integrate the interaction-specific information after the image feature extraction and the multi-modal fusion. We refer to the overall task as Multi-Modal Multi-Surface interactive segmentation (MMMS). We are able to show the effectiveness of our multi-modal fusion strategy.

Various means to boost ML's adversarial robustness have been proposed; however, they typically induce unfair robustness: It is often easier to attack from certain classes or groups than from others. Several techniques have been developed to improve adversarial robustness while seeking perfect fairness between classes. Yet, prior work has focused on settings where security and fairness are less critical. Our insight is that achieving perfect parity in realistic fairness-critical tasks, such as face recognition, is often infeasible -- some classes may be highly similar, leading to more misclassifications between them. Instead, we suggest that seeking symmetry -- i.e., attacks from class $i$ to $j$ would be as successful as from $j$ to $i$ -- is more tractable. Intuitively, symmetry is a desirable because class resemblance is a symmetric relation in most domains. Additionally, as we prove theoretically, symmetry between individuals induces symmetry between any set of sub-groups, in contrast to other fairness notions where group-fairness is often elusive. We develop Sy-FAR, a technique to encourage symmetry while also optimizing adversarial robustness and extensively evaluate it using five datasets, with three model architectures, including against targeted and untargeted realistic attacks. The results show Sy-FAR significantly improves fair adversarial robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we find that Sy-FAR is faster and more consistent across runs.

As the catalog grows, intra-class variability and a long tail of rare or visually similar items increase, and when combined with diverse packaging, cluttered containers, frequent occlusion, and large viewpoint changes-these factors amplify discrepancies between query and reference images, causing sharp performance drops for methods that rely solely on 2D appearance features. Thus, we propose RoboEye, a two-stage identification framework that dynamically augments 2D semantic features with domain-adapted 3D reasoning and lightweight adapters to bridge training deployment gaps. In the first stage, we train a large vision model to extract 2D features for generating candidate rankings. A lightweight 3D-feature-awareness module then estimates 3D feature quality and predicts whether 3D re-ranking is necessary, preventing performance degradation and avoiding unnecessary computation. When invoked, the second stage uses our robot 3D retrieval transformer, comprising a 3D feature extractor that produces geometry-aware dense features and a keypoint-based matcher that computes keypoint-correspondence confidences between query and reference images instead of conventional cosine-similarity scoring. Experiments show that RoboEye improves Recall@1 by 7.1% over the prior state of the art (RoboLLM). Moreover, RoboEye operates using only RGB images, avoiding reliance on explicit 3D inputs and reducing deployment costs.

While recent vision language models (VLMs) alleviate some of these constraints, they remain limited by their reliance on single pass representations, often failing to capture complementary aspects of visual content. In this paper, we introduce Multi Agent based Reasoning for Image Classification (MARIC), a multi agent framework that reformulates image classification as a collaborative reasoning process. MARIC first utilizes an Outliner Agent to analyze the global theme of the image and generate targeted prompts. Based on these prompts, three Aspect Agents extract fine grained descriptions along distinct visual dimensions. Finally, a Reasoning Agent synthesizes these complementary outputs through integrated reflection step, producing a unified representation for classification. By explicitly decomposing the task into multiple perspectives and encouraging reflective synthesis, MARIC mitigates the shortcomings of both parameter-heavy training and monolithic VLM reasoning. Experiments on 4 diverse image classification benchmark datasets demonstrate that MARIC significantly outperforms baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of multi-agent visual reasoning for robust and interpretable image classification.", "published": "2025-09-18", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.MA"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14860v1", "primary_category": "cs.CV"}

At the core of STEP is dCTS, a lightweight CNN-based policy network that enables flexible merging into superpatches.

Our analysis reveals that DiT blocks are the primary contributors to inference latency. Across diffusion timesteps, the feature variations of DiT blocks exhibit a U-shaped pattern with high similarity during intermediate timesteps, which suggests substantial computational redundancy. In this paper, we propose Block-Wise Caching (BWCache), a training-free method to accelerate DiT-based video generation. BWCache dynamically caches and reuses features from DiT blocks across diffusion timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce a similarity indicator that triggers feature reuse only when the differences between block features at adjacent timesteps fall below a threshold, thereby minimizing redundant computations while maintaining visual fidelity.

However, existing methods often struggle with multimodal misalignment and language semantic loss, especially in complex scenes containing multiple visually similar objects, where uniquely described targets are frequently mislocalized or incompletely segmented. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes TFANet, a Three-stage Image-Text Feature Alignment Network that systematically enhances multimodal alignment through a hierarchical framework comprising three stages: Knowledge Plus Stage (KPS), Knowledge Fusion Stage (KFS), and Knowledge Intensification Stage (KIS). In the first stage, we design the Multiscale Linear Cross-Attention Module (MLAM), which facilitates bidirectional semantic exchange between visual features and textual representations across multiple scales. This establishes rich and efficient alignment between image regions and different granularities of linguistic descriptions. Subsequently, the KFS further strengthens feature alignment through the Cross-modal Feature Scanning Module (CFSM), which applies multimodal selective scanning to capture long-range dependencies and construct a unified multimodal representation. This is essential for modeling long-range cross-modal dependencies and enhancing alignment accuracy in complex scenes. Finally, in the KIS, we propose the Word-level Linguistic Feature-guided Semantic Deepening Module (WFDM) to compensate for semantic degradation introduced in earlier stages.", "published": "2025-09-16", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13070v1", "primary_category": "cs.CV"}

Inspired by this success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance. However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual and reasoning capabilities.

Motivated by the hypothesis that sustained focus on key objects can improve LVLMs' visual capabilities, we propose Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS). The core idea of CLVS is to incorporate a vision memory that smooths the attention distribution across layers. Specifically, we initialize this vision memory with position-unbiased visual attention in the first layer. In subsequent layers, the model's visual attention jointly considers the vision memory from previous layers, while the memory is updated iteratively, thereby maintaining smooth attention on key objects. Given that visual understanding primarily occurs in the early and middle layers of the model, we use uncertainty as an indicator of completed visual understanding and terminate the smoothing process accordingly. Experiments on four benchmarks across three LVLMs confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of our method.

Our experiments show that MI2 scales more effectively for finding-related tasks, while RAD-DINO is stronger on tube-related tasks. Surprisingly, continually pretraining MI2 with both reports and structured labels using UniCL improves performance, underscoring the value of structured supervision at scale.

In contrast, we transform scalar rewards into a normalized target distribution using a learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL divergence between the policy and the target distribution. We implement this idea as a flow-balanced optimization method that promotes diverse exploration and generalizable reasoning trajectories.

Existing label-free methods, confidence minimization, self-consistency, or majority-vote objectives, stabilize learning but steadily shrink exploration, causing an entropy collapse: generations become shorter, less diverse, and brittle. Unlike prior approaches such as Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), which primarily adapt models to the immediate unlabeled dataset at hand, our goal is broader: to enable general improvements without sacrificing the model's inherent exploration capacity and generalization ability, i.e., evolving. We formalize this issue and propose EVolution-Oriented and Label-free Reinforcement Learning (EVOL-RL), a simple rule that couples stability with variation under a label-free setting. EVOL-RL keeps the majority-voted answer as a stable anchor (selection) while adding a novelty-aware reward that favors responses whose reasoning differs from what has already been produced (variation), measured in semantic space. Implemented with GRPO, EVOL-RL also uses asymmetric clipping to preserve strong signals and an entropy regularizer to sustain search. This majority-for-selection + novelty-for-variation design prevents collapse, maintains longer and more informative chains of thought, and improves both pass@1 and pass@n. EVOL-RL consistently outperforms the majority-only TTRL baseline; e.g., training on label-free AIME24 lifts Qwen3-4B-Base AIME25 pass@1 from TTRL's 4.6% to 16.4%, and pass@16 from 18.5% to 37.9%.

Previous solutions like semi-autoregressive address this issue by splitting windows into blocks, but this sacrifices speed and bidirectionality, eliminating the main advantage of diffusion models. To overcome this, we propose Convolutional decoding (Conv), a normalization-based method that narrows the decoding window without hard segmentation, leading to better fluency and flexibility.

Existing approaches mitigate this issue using KL penalties or clipping, which passively constrain updates rather than actively reducing the gap. We propose a simple yet effective data rewriting framework that proactively shrinks the policy gap by keeping correct solutions as on-policy data and rewriting incorrect ones with guided re-solving, falling back to expert demonstrations only when needed. This aligns the training distribution with the target policy before optimization, reducing importance sampling variance and stabilizing off-policy fine-tuning.

We used idealised models of information flow, artificial neural networks (ANNs), to evaluate whether changes in information flow in a network can yield a transitional change in cognitive performance. We compared networks with feed-forward, recurrent and laminated topologies, and tested their performance learning artificial grammars that differed in complexity, controlling for network size and resources. We documented a qualitative expansion in the types of input that recurrent networks can process compared to feed-forward networks, and a related qualitative increase in performance for learning the most complex grammars. We also noted how the difficulty in training recurrent networks poses a form of transition barrier and contingent irreversibility -- other key features of evolutionary transitions.

These issues are especially critical in software engineering tasks where concise and deterministic outputs are required. To investigate these trade-offs, we conduct an empirical study based on code generation benchmarks. The results reveal that longer CoT does not always help. Excessive reasoning often causes truncation, accuracy drops, and latency up to five times higher, with failed outputs consistently longer than successful ones. These findings challenge the assumption that longer reasoning is inherently better and highlight the need for adaptive CoT control.

Integrating external tools has emerged as a promising approach to bridge this gap. Despite recent advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: constructing tool-integrated reasoning data, performing fine-grained optimization, and enhancing inference. To overcome these limitations, we propose THOR (Tool-Integrated Hierarchical Optimization via RL). First, we introduce TIRGen, a multi-agent actor-critic-based pipeline for constructing high-quality datasets of tool-integrated reasoning paths, aligning with the policy and generalizing well across diverse models. Second, to perform fine-grained hierarchical optimization, we introduce an RL strategy that jointly optimizes for both trajectory-level problem solving and step-level code generation. This is motivated by our key insight that the success of an intermediate tool call is a strong predictor of the final answer's correctness. Finally, THOR incorporates a self-correction mechanism that leverages immediate tool feedback to dynamically revise erroneous reasoning paths during inference. Our approach demonstrates strong generalization across diverse models, performing effectively in both reasoning and non-reasoning models.

Here we present a natural language processing (NLP) screening tool to detect high-severity incident reports in radiation oncology across two institutions.   METHODS AND MATERIALS: We used two text datasets to train and evaluate our NLP models: 7,094 reports from our institution (Inst.), and 571 from IAEA SAFRON (SF), all of which had severity scores labeled by clinical content experts. We trained and evaluated two types of models: baseline support vector machines (SVM) and BlueBERT which is a large language model pretrained on PubMed abstracts and hospitalized patient data. We assessed for generalizability of our model in two ways. First, we evaluated models trained using Inst.-train on SF-test. Second, we trained a BlueBERT_TRANSFER model that was first fine-tuned on Inst.-train then on SF-train before testing on SF-test set. To further analyze model performance, we also examined a subset of 59 reports from our Inst. dataset, which were manually edited for clarity.   RESULTS Classification performance on the Inst. test achieved AUROC 0.82 using SVM and 0.81 using BlueBERT. Without cross-institution transfer learning, performance on the SF test was limited to an AUROC of 0.42 using SVM and 0.56 using BlueBERT. BlueBERT_TRANSFER, which was fine-tuned on both datasets, improved the performance on SF test to AUROC 0.78. Performance of SVM, and BlueBERT_TRANSFER models on the manually curated Inst. reports (AUROC 0.85 and 0.74) was similar to human performance (AUROC 0.81).

We introduce **Dynamic Self-reinforcing Calibration for Hallucination Suppression (DSCC-HS)**, a novel, proactive framework that intervenes during autoregressive decoding. Inspired by dual-process cognitive theory, DSCC-HS uses a compact proxy model, trained in adversarial roles as a Factual Alignment Proxy (FAP) and a Hallucination Detection Proxy (HDP). During inference, these proxies dynamically steer a large target model by injecting a real-time steering vector, which is the difference between FAP and HDP logits, at each decoding step. This plug-and-play approach requires no modification to the target model. Our experiments on TruthfulQA and BioGEN show DSCC-HS achieves state-of-the-art performance. On TruthfulQA, it reached a 99.2% Factual Consistency Rate (FCR). On the long-form BioGEN benchmark, it attained the highest FActScore of 46.50.

This motivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions and understand LLM behavior at a more granular level.

Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise interventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show that the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust target representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a single A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks.

In particular, seemingly innocuous responses, when composed across interactions, can cumulatively enable adversaries to recover sensitive information, a phenomenon we term compositional privacy leakage. We present the first systematic study of such compositional privacy leaks and possible mitigation methods in multi-agent LLM systems. First, we develop a framework that models how auxiliary knowledge and agent interactions jointly amplify privacy risks, even when each response is benign in isolation. Next, to mitigate this, we propose and evaluate two defense strategies: (1) Theory-of-Mind defense (ToM), where defender agents infer a questioner's intent by anticipating how their outputs may be exploited by adversaries, and (2) Collaborative Consensus Defense (CoDef), where responder agents collaborate with peers who vote based on a shared aggregated state to restrict sensitive information spread. Crucially, we balance our evaluation across compositions that expose sensitive information and compositions that yield benign inferences. Our experiments quantify how these defense strategies differ in balancing the privacy-utility trade-off. We find that while chain-of-thought alone offers limited protection to leakage (~39% sensitive blocking rate), our ToM defense substantially improves sensitive query blocking (up to 97%) but can reduce benign task success. CoDef achieves the best balance, yielding the highest Balanced Outcome (79.8%), highlighting the benefit of combining explicit reasoning with defender collaboration.
