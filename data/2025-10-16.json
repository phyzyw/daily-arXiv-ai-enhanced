{"id": "2510.13112", "title": "Neural Triangular Transport Maps: A New Approach Towards Sampling in Lattice QCD", "authors": ["Andrey Bryutkin", "Youssef Marzouk"], "summary": "Lattice field theories are fundamental testbeds for computational physics; yet, sampling their Boltzmann distributions remains challenging due to multimodality and long-range correlations. While normalizing flows offer a promising alternative, their application to large lattices is often constrained by prohibitive memory requirements and the challenge of maintaining sufficient model expressivity. We propose sparse triangular transport maps that explicitly exploit the conditional independence structure of the lattice graph under periodic boundary conditions using monotone rectified neural networks (MRNN). We introduce a comprehensive framework for triangular transport maps that navigates the fundamental trade-off between \\emph{exact sparsity} (respecting marginal conditional independence in the target distribution) and \\emph{approximate sparsity} (computational tractability without fill-ins). Restricting each triangular map component to a local past enables site-wise parallel evaluation and linear time complexity in lattice size $N$, while preserving the expressive, invertible structure. Using $\\phi^4$ in two dimensions as a controlled setting, we analyze how node labelings (orderings) affect the sparsity and performance of triangular maps. We compare against Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) and established flow approaches (RealNVP).", "published": "2025-10-15", "categories": ["cs.LG", "hep-lat", "physics.comp-ph", "stat.ML", "82B20, 65C05, 68T07, 60J22", "G.3; I.6.8; J.2"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13112v1", "primary_category": "cs.LG"}

Thakur"], "summary": "Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized the modeling of materials and molecules by directly fitting to ab initio data. However, while these models excel at capturing local and semi-local interactions, they often prove insufficient when an explicit and efficient treatment of long-range interactions is required. To address this limitation, we introduce Reciprocal-Space Attention (RSA), a framework designed to capture long-range interactions in the Fourier domain. RSA can be integrated with any existing local or semi-local MLIP framework. The central contribution of this work is the mapping of a linear-scaling attention mechanism into Fourier space, enabling the explicit modeling of long-range interactions such as electrostatics and dispersion without relying on predefined charges or other empirical assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method as a long-range correction to the MACE backbone across diverse benchmarks, including dimer binding curves, dispersion-dominated layered phosphorene exfoliation, and the molecular dipole density of bulk water. Our results show that RSA consistently captures long-range physics across a broad range of chemical and materials systems.

Tempelman", "Adam J. Wachtor", "Eric B. Flynn"], "summary": "Automated ultrasonic weld inspection remains a significant challenge in the nondestructive evaluation (NDE) community to factors such as limited training data (due to the complexity of curating experimental specimens or high-fidelity simulations) and environmental volatility of many industrial settings (resulting in the corruption of on-the-fly measurements). Thus, an end-to-end machine learning (ML) workflow for acoustic weld inspection in realistic (i.e., industrial) settings has remained an elusive goal. This work addresses the challenges of data curation and signal corruption by proposing workflow consisting of a reduced-order modeling scheme, diffusion based distribution alignment, and U-Net-based segmentation and inversion. A reduced-order Helmholtz model based on Lamb wave theory is used to generate a comprehensive dataset over varying weld heterogeneity and crack defects. The relatively inexpensive low-order solutions provide a robust training dateset for inversion models which are refined through a transfer learning stage using a limited set of full 3D elastodynamic simulations. To handle out-of-distribution (OOD) real-world measurements with varying and unpredictable noise distributions, i.e., Laser Doppler Vibrometry scans, guided diffusion produces in-distribution representations of OOD experimental LDV scans which are subsequently processed by the inversion models. This integrated framework provides an end-to-end solution for automated weld inspection on real data.", "published": "2025-10-14", "categories": ["cs.LG", "physics.comp-ph"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13023v1", "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
