(Jung H, Covino R, Arjun A, et al., Nat Comput Sci. 3:334-345 (2023)) introduced Artificial Intelligence for Molecular Mechanism Discovery (AIMMD), a novel sampling algorithm that integrates machine learning to enhance the efficiency of transition path sampling (TPS). By enabling on-the-fly estimation of the committor probability and simultaneously deriving a human-interpretable reaction coordinate, AIMMD offers a robust framework for elucidating the mechanistic pathways of complex molecular processes. This commentary provides a discussion and critical analysis of the core AIMMD framework, explores its recent extensions, and offers an assessment of the method's potential impact and limitations.", "published": "2026-02-05", "categories": ["physics.comp-ph", "cond-mat.soft", "cond-mat.stat-mech", "cs.LG", "physics.chem-ph"], "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.05167v1", "primary_category": "physics.comp-ph"}
{"id": "2602.04975", "title": "Stochastic hierarchical data-driven optimization: application to plasma-surface kinetics", "authors": ["José Afonso", "Vasco Guerra", "Pedro Viegas"], "summary": "This work introduces a stochastic hierarchical optimization framework inspired by Sloppy Model theory for the efficient calibration of physical models. Central to this method is the use of a reduced Hessian approximation, which identifies and targets the stiff parameter subspace using minimal simulation queries. This strategy enables efficient navigation of highly anisotropic landscapes, avoiding the computational burden of exhaustive sampling. To ensure rigorous inference, we integrate this approach with a probabilistic formulation that derives a principled objective loss function directly from observed data. We validate the framework by applying it to the problem of plasma-surface interactions, where accurate modelling is strictly limited by uncertainties in surface reactivity parameters and the computational cost of kinetic simulations. Comparative analysis demonstrates that our method consistently outperforms baseline optimization techniques in sample efficiency. This approach offers a general and scalable tool for optimizing models of complex reaction systems, ranging from plasma chemistry to biochemical networks.", "published": "2026-02-04", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "physics.chem-ph", "physics.plasm-ph"], "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04975v1", "primary_category": "cs.LG"}

We investigate this question by tracing how ESMFold folds a beta hairpin, a prevalent structural motif. Through counterfactual interventions on model latents, we identify two computational stages in the folding trunk. In the first stage, early blocks initialize pairwise biochemical signals: residue identities and associated biochemical features such as charge flow from sequence representations into pairwise representations. In the second stage, late blocks develop pairwise spatial features: distance and contact information accumulate in the pairwise representation. We demonstrate that the mechanisms underlying structural decisions of ESMFold can be localized, traced through interpretable representations, and manipulated with strong causal effects.", "published": "2026-02-05", "categories": ["cs.LG", "q-bio.BM"], "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.06020v1", "primary_category": "cs.LG"}

Rosas", "Alexander Stapleton", "Lucas Teixeira", "Dmitry Vaintrob"], "summary": "Neural networks organize information according to the hierarchical, multi-scale structure of natural data. Methods to interpret model internals should be similarly scale-aware, explicitly tracking how features compose across resolutions and guaranteeing bounds on the influence of fine-grained structure that is discarded as irrelevant noise. We posit that the renormalisation framework from physics can meet this need by offering technical tools that can overcome limitations of current methods. Moreover, relevant work from adjacent fields has now matured to a point where scattered research threads can be synthesized into practical, theory-informed tools. To combine these threads in an AI safety context, we propose a unifying research agenda -- \\emph{scale-aware interpretability} -- to develop formal machinery and interpretability tools that have robustness and faithfulness properties supported by statistical physics.", "published": "2026-02-05", "categories": ["hep-th", "cond-mat.dis-nn", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.05184v1", "primary_category": "hep-th"}

In this work, we represent the Hilbert space of an HAF as a weighted graph, which we term the Hilbert graph (HG), whose vertices are spin configurations and whose edges are generated by off-diagonal spin-flip terms of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, with weights set by products of wavefunction amplitudes. Holding the amplitudes fixed and restricting phases to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ values, the phase-dependent variational energy can be recast as a classical Ising antiferromagnet on the HG, so that phase reconstruction of the ground state reduces to a weighted Max-Cut instance. This shows that phase reconstruction HAF is worst-case NP-hard and provides a direct link between wavefunction sign structure and combinatorial optimization.", "published": "2026-02-04", "categories": ["cond-mat.str-el", "cond-mat.dis-nn", "cs.AI", "cs.CC", "quant-ph"], "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04943v1", "primary_category": "cond-mat.str-el"}
