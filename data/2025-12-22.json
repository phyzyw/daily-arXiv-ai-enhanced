C. Xie"], "summary": "The crystal structure of high-pressure solid hydrogen remains a fundamental open problem. Although the research frontier has mostly shifted toward ultra-high pressure phases above 400 GPa, we show that even the broken symmetry phase observed around 130~GPa requires revisiting due to its intricate coupling of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. Here, we develop a first principle quantum Monte Carlo framework based on a deep neural network wave function that treats both electrons and nuclei quantum mechanically within the constant pressure ensemble. Our calculations reveal an unreported ground-state structure candidate for the broken symmetry phase with $Cmcm$ space group symmetry, and we test its stability up to 96 atoms. The predicted structure quantitatively matches the experimental equation of state and X-ray diffraction patterns. Furthermore, our group-theoretical analysis shows that the $Cmcm$ structure is compatible with existing Raman and infrared spectroscopic data. Crucially, static density functional theory calculation reveals the $Cmcm$ structure as a dynamically unstable saddle point on the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface, demonstrating that a full quantum many-body treatment of the problem is necessary. These results shed new light on the phase diagram of high-pressure hydrogen and call for further experimental verifications.", "published": "2025-12-19", "categories": ["cond-mat.str-el", "cond-mat.mtrl-sci", "cs.LG", "physics.comp-ph"], "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17703v1", "primary_category": "cond-mat.str-el"}

Therefore, we present three different synthetically generated datasets with increasing complexity for training, using a Monte-Carlo Simulation application based on Geant4. On those datasets, we evaluate convolutional and fully connected architectures of neural networks to demonstrate which design decisions work well for reconstructing the fluence and spectra distributions over the spatial domain of such radiation fields.

This first-of-its-kind study at such a scale uses machine learning to classify food processing levels (NOVA) based on the Open Food Facts dataset of over 900,000 products. Models including LightGBM, Random Forest, and CatBoost were trained on nutrient concentration data. LightGBM performed best, achieving 80-85% accuracy across different nutrient panels and effectively distinguishing minimally from ultra-processed foods. Exploratory analysis revealed strong associations between higher NOVA classes and lower Nutri-Scores, indicating poorer nutritional quality. Products in NOVA 3 and 4 also had higher carbon footprints and lower Eco-Scores, suggesting greater environmental impact. Allergen analysis identified gluten and milk as common in ultra-processed items, posing risks to sensitive individuals. Categories like Cakes and Snacks were dominant in higher NOVA classes, which also had more additives, highlighting the role of ingredient modification. This study, leveraging the largest dataset of NOVA-labeled products, emphasizes the health, environmental, and allergenic implications of food processing and showcases machine learning's value in scalable classification.

{"id": "2512.17426", "title": "Perfect reconstruction of sparse signals using nonconvexity control and one-step RSB message passing", "authors": ["Xiaosi Gu", "Ayaka Sakata", "Tomoyuki Obuchi"], "summary": "We consider sparse signal reconstruction via minimization of the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty, and develop one-step replica-symmetry-breaking (1RSB) extensions of approximate message passing (AMP), termed 1RSB-AMP. Starting from the 1RSB formulation of belief propagation, we derive explicit update rules of 1RSB-AMP together with the corresponding state evolution (1RSB-SE) equations. A detailed comparison shows that 1RSB-AMP and 1RSB-SE agree remarkably well at the macroscopic level, even in parameter regions where replica-symmetric (RS) AMP, termed RS-AMP, diverges and where the 1RSB description itself is not expected to be thermodynamically exact. Fixed-point analysis of 1RSB-SE reveals a phase diagram consisting of success, failure, and diverging phases, as in the RS case. However, the diverging-region boundary now depends on the Parisi parameter due to the 1RSB ansatz, and we propose a new criterion -- minimizing the size of the diverging region -- rather than the conventional zero-complexity condition, to determine its value. Combining this criterion with the nonconvexity-control (NCC) protocol proposed in a previous RS study improves the algorithmic limit of perfect reconstruction compared with RS-AMP. Numerical solutions of 1RSB-SE and experiments with 1RSB-AMP confirm that this improved limit is achieved in practice, though the gain is modest and remains slightly inferior to the Bayes-optimal threshold. We also report the behavior of thermodynamic quantities -- overlaps, free entropy, complexity, and the non-self-averaging susceptibility -- that characterize the 1RSB phase in this problem.", "published": "2025-12-19", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cond-mat.dis-nn", "cs.LG"], "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17426v1", "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
