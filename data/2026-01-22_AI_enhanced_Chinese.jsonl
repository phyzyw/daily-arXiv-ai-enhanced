Cordoni"], "summary": "The relationship between the physical characteristics of the radiation field and biological damage is central to both radiotherapy and radioprotection, yet the link between spatial scales of energy deposition and biological effects remains not entirely understood. To address this, we developed an interpretable deep learning model that predicts cell survival after proton and carbon ion irradiation, leveraging sequential attention to highlight relevant features and provide insight into the contribution of different energy deposition scales. Trained and tested on the PIDE dataset, our model incorporates, beside LET, nanodosimetric and microdosimetric quantities simulated with MC-Startrack and Open-TOPAS, enabling multi-scale characterization. While achieving high predictive accuracy, our approach also emphasizes transparency in decision-making. We demonstrate high accuracy in predicting RBE for in vitro experiments. Multiple scales are utilized concurrently, with no single spatial scale being predominant. Quantities defined at smaller spatial domains generally have a greater influence, whereas the LET plays a lesser role.", "abs": "", "categories": ["physics.bio-ph", "cs.LG"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出了一种可解释的多尺度深度学习模型，用于预测质子和碳离子辐照后的细胞存活率，该模型利用序列注意机制突出显示相关特征，并揭示不同能量沉积尺度对生物效应的贡献。", "motivation": "为了更好地理解辐射场物理特性与生物损伤之间的关系，以及不同空间尺度的能量沉积与生物效应之间的联系，特别是在粒子治疗中优化治疗效果和减少不良后果。", "method": "研究人员开发了一个可解释的深度学习模型，该模型整合了LET、纳米剂量学和微剂量学量，并利用序列注意机制进行多尺度特征分析。模型使用PIDE数据集进行训练和测试，并结合MC-Startrack和Open-TOPAS模拟。", "result": "模型在预测RBE方面表现出高精度，并且证明了在预测细胞存活率时，较小空间尺度定义的量通常具有更大的影响，而LET的作用相对较小，没有单一的空间尺度占据主导地位。", "conclusion": "该研究表明，多尺度特征的联合利用能够更准确地预测细胞存活率，并为粒子治疗的优化和生物效应的理解提供了新的视角，强调了在辐射生物学中考虑多尺度效应的重要性。"}}
{"id": "2601.14810", "title": "Learning and extrapolating scale-invariant processes", "authors": ["Anaclara Alvez-Canepa", "Cyril Furtlehner", "François Landes"], "summary": "Machine Learning (ML) has deeply changed some fields recently, like Language and Vision and we may expect it to be relevant also to the analysis of of complex systems. Here we want to tackle the question of how and to which extent can one regress scale-free processes, i.e. processes displaying power law behavior, like earthquakes or avalanches? We are interested in predicting the large ones, i.e. rare events in the training set which therefore require extrapolation capabilities of the model. For this we consider two paradigmatic problems that are statistically self-similar. The first one is a 2-dimensional fractional Gaussian field obeying linear dynamics, self-similar by construction and amenable to exact analysis. The second one is the Abelian sandpile model, exhibiting self-organized criticality. The emerging paradigm of Geometric Deep Learning shows that including known symmetries into the model's architecture is key to success. Here one may hope to extrapolate only by leveraging scale invariance. This is however a peculiar symmetry, as it involves possibly non-trivial coarse-graining operations and anomalous scaling. We perform experiments on various existing architectures like U-net, Riesz network (scale invariant by construction), or our own proposals: a wavelet-decomposition based Graph Neural Network (with discrete scale symmetry), a Fourier embedding layer and a Fourier-Mellin Neural Operator. Based on these experiments and a complete characterization of the linear case, we identify the main issues relative to spectral biases and coarse-grained representations, and discuss how to alleviate them with the relevant inductive biases.", "abs": "", "categories": ["cond-mat.dis-nn", "cs.LG"], "AI": {"tldr": "本文研究了如何利用机器学习预测具有尺度不变特性的复杂系统，尤其关注在训练数据尾部进行外推的问题。通过对分数高斯场和阿贝尔沙堆模型进行实验，揭示了频谱偏差和粗粒化表示对模型外推能力的影响。", "motivation": "传统机器学习模型在描述和预测复杂物理系统时面临挑战，尤其是在处理稀有、非线性事件和尺度不变性时。本文旨在探索如何利用机器学习外推尺度不变过程，例如地震或雪崩。", "method": "研究人员考虑了两个具有统计自相似性的模型：2维分数高斯场和阿贝尔沙堆模型。他们尝试了多种架构，包括U-Net、Riesz网络、基于小波分解的图神经网络、傅里叶嵌入层和傅里叶-梅林神经网络算子，并对线性情况进行了全面分析。", "result": "实验结果表明，大多数机器学习模型存在频谱偏差，倾向于学习低频特征，导致外推能力不足。研究人员识别了频谱偏差和粗粒化表示是影响模型外推能力的主要问题。", "conclusion": "本文强调了在机器学习模型中引入适当的归纳偏差（例如尺度不变性）的重要性，以克服频谱偏差和粗粒化表示问题，从而提高模型在尺度不变系统中的外推能力。"}}
