Conductive electrodes, produced via femtosecond IR laser pulses, exhibit high resistivity that delays signal propagation. This effect necessitates extending the classical Ramo-Shockley weighting potential formalism. We model the phenomenon through a 3rd-order, 3+1D PDE derived as a quasi-stationary approximation of Maxwell's equations. The PDE is solved numerically and coupled with charge transport simulations for realistic 3D sensor geometries. A Mixture-of-Experts Physics-Informed Neural Network, trained on Spectral Method data, provides a meshless solver to assess timing degradation from electrode resistance.", "published": "2025-09-25", "categories": ["physics.ins-det", "cs.LG", "hep-ex", "physics.comp-ph", "I.2.6; I.6.1"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21123v1", "primary_category": "physics.ins-det"}
