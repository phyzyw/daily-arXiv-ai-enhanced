Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a recent machine learning-based approach, for which many properties and limitations remain unknown. PINNs are widely accepted as inferior to traditional methods for solving PDEs, such as the finite element method, both with regard to computation time and accuracy. However, PINNs are commonly claimed to show promise in solving inverse problems and handling noisy or incomplete data. We compare the performance of PINNs in solving inverse problems with that of a traditional approach using the finite element method combined with a numerical optimizer. The models are tested on a series of increasingly difficult fluid mechanics problems, with and without noise. We find that while PINNs may require less human effort and specialized knowledge, they are outperformed by the traditional approach.

A common inference task is to recover full-field information of physical systems from a small number of noisy observations, a usually highly ill-posed problem. Critically, engineering systems often have complicated and variable geometries prohibiting the use of standard Bayesian UQ. In this work, we introduce Geometric Autoencoders for Bayesian Inversion (GABI), a framework for learning geometry-aware generative models of physical responses that serve as highly informative geometry-conditioned priors for Bayesian inversion. Following a ''learn first, observe later'' paradigm, GABI distills information from large datasets of systems with varying geometries, without requiring knowledge of governing PDEs, boundary conditions, or observation processes, into a rich latent prior. At inference time, this prior is seamlessly combined with the likelihood of the specific observation process, yielding a geometry-adapted posterior distribution. Our proposed framework is architecture agnostic. A creative use of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) sampling yields an efficient implementation that utilizes modern GPU hardware. We test our method on: steady-state heat over rectangular domains; Reynold-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) flow around airfoils; Helmholtz resonance and source localization on 3D car bodies; RANS airflow over terrain. We find: the predictive accuracy to be comparable to deterministic supervised learning approaches in the restricted setting where supervised learning is applicable; UQ to be well calibrated and robust on challenging problems with complex geometries.

In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of \"ghost states\" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix.

When predicting state-dependent thermodynamic properties, ML models need to account for both molecular structure and the thermodynamic state, described by independent variables, typically temperature, pressure, and composition. Modern molecular ML models typically include state information by adding it to molecular fingerprint vectors or by embedding explicit (semi-empirical) thermodynamic relations. Here, we propose to rather split the information processing on the molecular structure and the dependency on states into two separate network channels: a graph neural network and a multilayer perceptron, whose output is combined by a dot product. We refer to our approach as DeepEOSNet, as this idea is based on the DeepONet architecture [Lu et al. (2021), Nat. Mach. Intell.]: instead of operators, we learn state dependencies, with the possibility to predict equation of states (EOS). We investigate the predictive performance of DeepEOSNet by means of three case studies, which include the prediction of vapor pressure as a function of temperature, and mixture molar volume as a function of composition, temperature, and pressure. Our results show superior performance of DeepEOSNet for predicting vapor pressure and comparable performance for predicting mixture molar volume compared to state-of-research graph-based thermodynamic prediction models from our earlier works. In fact, we see large potential of DeepEOSNet in cases where data is sparse in the state domain and the output function is structurally similar across different molecules.

Nevertheless, the temporal dynamics also play a vital role in biological neural networks, whose temporal structure is a crucial feature to examine. Biological neural networks display complex intermittency and, thus, can be studied through the lens of the temporal complexity (TC) theory. The TC approach look at the metastability of self-organized states, characterized by a power-law decay in the inter-event time distribution and in the total activity distribution or a scaling behavior in the corresponding event-driven diffusion processes. In this study, we present a temporal complexity (TC) analysis of a biologically-inspired Hopfield-type neural network model. We conducted a comparative assessment between scale-free and random network topologies, with particular emphasis on their global activation patterns. Our parametric analysis revealed comparable dynamical behaviors across both neural network architectures.
