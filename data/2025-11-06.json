Movahed"], "summary": "In this work, we perform a simulation-based forecasting analysis to compare the constraining power of two higher-order summary statistics of the large-scale structure (LSS), the Minkowski Functionals (MFs) and the Conditional Moments of Derivative (CMD), with a particular focus on their sensitivity to nonlinear and anisotropic features in redshift-space. Our analysis relies on halo catalogs from the Big Sobol Sequence(BSQ) simulations at redshift $z=0.5$, employing a likelihood-free inference framework implemented via neural posterior estimation. At the fiducial cosmology of the Quijote simulations $(\\Omega_{m}=0.3175,\\,\\sigma_{8}=0.834)$, and for the smoothing scale $R=15\\,h^{-1}$Mpc, we find that the CMD yields tighter forecasts for $(\\Omega_{m}},\\,\\sigma_{8})$ than the zeroth- to third-order MFs components, improving the constraint precision by ${\\sim}(44\\%,\\,52\\%)$, ${\\sim}(30\\%,\\,45\\%)$, ${\\sim}(27\\%,\\,17\\%)$, and ${\\sim}(26\\%,\\,17\\%)$, respectively. A joint configuration combining the MFs and CMD further enhances the precision by approximately ${\\sim}27\\%$ compared to the standard MFs alone, highlighting the complementary anisotropy-sensitive information captured by the CMD in contrast to the scalar morphological content encapsulated by the MFs. We further extend the forecasting analysis to a continuous range of cosmological parameter values and multiple smoothing scales. Our results show that, although the absolute forecast uncertainty for each component of summary statistics depends on the underlying parameter values and the adopted smoothing scale, the relative constraining power among the summary statistics remains nearly constant throughout.", "published": "2025-11-05", "categories": ["astro-ph.CO", "cs.LG", "physics.comp-ph"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03636v1", "primary_category": "astro-ph.CO"}
{"id": "2511.03129", "title": "Optimal Boundary Control of Diffusion on Graphs via Linear Programming", "authors": ["Harbir Antil", "Rainald Löhner", "Felipe Pérez"], "summary": "We propose a linear programming (LP) framework for steady-state diffusion and flux optimization on geometric networks. The state variable satisfies a discrete diffusion law on a weighted, oriented graph, where conductances are scaled by edge lengths to preserve geometric fidelity. Boundary potentials act as controls that drive interior fluxes according to a linear network Laplacian. The optimization problem enforces physically meaningful sign and flux-cap constraints at all boundary edges, derived directly from a gradient bound. This yields a finite-dimensional LP whose feasible set is polyhedral, and whose boundedness and solvability follow from simple geometric or algebraic conditions on the network data.   We prove that under the absence of negative recession directions--automatically satisfied in the presence of finite box bounds, flux caps, or sign restrictions--the LP admits a global minimizer. Several sufficient conditions guaranteeing boundedness of the feasible region are identified, covering both full-rank and rank-deficient flux maps. The analysis connects classical results such as the Minkowski--Weyl decomposition, Hoffman's bound, and the fundamental theorem of linear programming with modern network-based diffusion modeling.   Two large-scale examples illustrate the framework: (i) A typical large stadium in a major modern city, which forms a single connected component with relatively uniform corridor widths, and a (ii) A complex street network emanating from a large, historical city center, which forms a multi-component system.", "published": "2025-11-05", "categories": ["math.OC", "cs.AI", "physics.comp-ph"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03129v1", "primary_category": "math.OC"}

Digitizing the cell by mapping the intricate organellar networks into its physiological and pathological textures will revolutionarize the contents of cell atlases. To meet the requirements of characterizing intracellular organelles and their interactions within defined cellular cohorts at tissue level, we have developed DeepOrganelle. It adopts a lightweighted Mask2Former frameworks as a universal segmentor and is capable of segmenting and extracting organelles within different cell types, performing statistical quantitative analysis, as well as visualizing and quantifying the spatial distribution of organelle morphologies and interactions across different cell types at tissue scales. Using DeepOrganelle, we systemically perform cross-scale quantification of membrane contact sites(MCSs) dynamics across the progression of the seminiferous epithelial cycle, covering 12 distinct developmental stages and 24 statuses of germ cells. DeepOrganelle uncovers the spatiotemporal gradient of the germ cell differentiation atlas according to different types of organelles and their interactions. Noticeably, it discovers a waved pattern of mitochondria(Mito)-endoplasmic reticulum(ER) contact with a significant increase specifically at Stage X pachytene preceding the transition to diplotene, which aligns well with a newly reported experiment that mitochondrial metabolic proteins like PDHA2 are essential for this transition by maintaining ATP supply for double-strand break(DSB) repair. DeepOrganelle also observes a dynamic restructuring of the blood-testis barrier and stage-specific reorganization of organelle topography in Sertoli cells from preleptotene to leptotene phases of prophase I.", "published": "2025-11-02", "categories": ["physics.bio-ph", "cs.AI"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02860v1", "primary_category": "physics.bio-ph"}

Yet little is known theoretically about the impact of Sobolev training -- regression with both function and gradient data -- on the generalization error of highly overparameterized predictive models in high dimensions. In this paper, we obtain a precise characterization of this training modality for random feature (RF) models in the limit where the number of trainable parameters, input dimensions, and training data tend proportionally to infinity. Our model for Sobolev training reflects practical implementations by sketching gradient data onto finite dimensional subspaces. By combining the replica method from statistical physics with linearizations in operator-valued free probability theory, we derive a closed-form description for the generalization errors of the trained RF models. For target functions described by single-index models, we demonstrate that supplementing function data with additional gradient data does not universally improve predictive performance. Rather, the degree of overparameterization should inform the choice of training method. More broadly, our results identify settings where models perform optimally by interpolating noisy function and gradient data.", "published": "2025-11-04", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cond-mat.dis-nn", "cs.LG", "math.PR", "math.ST", "stat.TH"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03050v1", "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
