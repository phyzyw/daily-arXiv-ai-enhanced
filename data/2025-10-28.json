In the PIML setting, Chebyshev-based physics-informed KANs (cPIKANs) have become the standard due to their computational efficiency. However, like their multilayer perceptron-based counterparts, cPIKANs face significant challenges when scaled to depth, leading to training instabilities that limit their applicability to several PDE problems. To address this, we propose a basis-agnostic, Glorot-like initialization scheme that preserves activation variance and yields substantial improvements in stability and accuracy over the default initialization of cPIKANs. Inspired by the PirateNet architecture, we further introduce Residual-Gated Adaptive KANs (RGA KANs), designed to mitigate divergence in deep cPIKANs where initialization alone is not sufficient. Through empirical tests and information bottleneck analysis, we show that RGA KANs successfully traverse all training phases, unlike baseline cPIKANs, which stagnate in the diffusion phase in specific PDE settings. Evaluations on seven standard forward PDE benchmarks under a fixed training pipeline with adaptive components demonstrate that RGA KANs consistently outperform parameter-matched cPIKANs and PirateNets - often by several orders of magnitude - while remaining stable in settings where the others diverge.", "published": "2025-10-27", "categories": ["cs.LG", "physics.comp-ph"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23501v1", "primary_category": "cs.LG"}

However, the scaling fails due to some small-scale, short-timescale phenomena, such as supernova explosions. We have developed a novel integration scheme of $N$-body/hydrodynamics simulations working with machine learning. This approach bypasses the short timesteps caused by supernova explosions using a surrogate model, thereby improving scalability. With this method, we reached 300 billion particles using 148,900 nodes, equivalent to 7,147,200 CPU cores, breaking through the billion-particle barrier currently faced by state-of-the-art simulations. This resolution allows us to perform the first star-by-star galaxy simulation, which resolves individual stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. The performance scales over $10^4$ CPU cores, an upper limit in the current state-of-the-art simulations using both A64FX and X86-64 processors and NVIDIA CUDA GPUs.", "published": "2025-10-27", "categories": ["astro-ph.GA", "cs.DC", "cs.LG", "physics.comp-ph"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23330v1", "primary_category": "astro-ph.GA"}

We present a massively parallel GPU-based simulation framework that enables fully coupled, large-scale modeling of on-chip magnon-photon circuits.

To accelerate design workflows, we develop a physics-informed machine learning surrogate trained on the simulation data, reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy. This combined approach reveals real-time energy exchange dynamics and reproduces key phenomena such as anti-crossing behavior and the suppression of ferromagnetic resonance under strong electromagnetic fields.

In fact these models learn to transform noise into data through a series of vector field updates, however the meaning of each step remains opaque. We address this problem by proposing a general framework constraining each flow step to be sampled from a known physical distribution. Flow trajectories are mapped to (and constrained to traverse) the equilibrium states of the simulated physical process. We implement this approach through the 2D Ising model in such a way that flow steps become thermal equilibrium points along a parametric cooling schedule.   Our proposed architecture includes an encoder that maps discrete Ising configurations into a continuous latent space, a flow-matching network that performs temperature-driven diffusion, and a projector that returns to discrete Ising states while preserving physical constraints.   We validate this framework across multiple lattice sizes, showing that it preserves physical fidelity while outperforming Monte Carlo generation in speed as the lattice size increases. In contrast with standard flow matching, each vector field represents a meaningful stepwise transition in the 2D Ising model's latent space. This demonstrates that embedding physical semantics into generative flows transforms opaque neural trajectories into interpretable physical processes.", "published": "2025-10-24", "categories": ["cs.LG", "math.ST", "physics.app-ph", "physics.comp-ph", "stat.TH", "68T07"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21210v1", "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"id": "2510.21368", "title": "Efficient Exploration of Chemical Kinetics", "authors": ["Rohit Goswami"], "summary": "Estimating reaction rates and chemical stability is fundamental, yet efficient methods for large-scale simulations remain out of reach despite advances in modeling and exascale computing. Direct simulation is limited by short timescales; machine-learned potentials require large data sets and struggle with transition state regions essential for reaction rates. Reaction network exploration with sufficient accuracy is hampered by the computational cost of electronic structure calculations, and even simplifications like harmonic transition state theory rely on prohibitively expensive saddle point searches. Surrogate model-based acceleration has been promising but hampered by overhead and numerical instability.   This dissertation presents a holistic solution, co-designing physical representations, statistical models, and systems architecture in the Optimal Transport Gaussian Process (OT-GP) framework. Using physics-aware optimal transport metrics, OT-GP creates compact, chemically relevant surrogates of the potential energy surface, underpinned by statistically robust sampling. Alongside EON software rewrites for long timescale simulations, we introduce reinforcement learning approaches for both minimum-mode following (when the final state is unknown) and nudged elastic band methods (when endpoints are specified). Collectively, these advances establish a representation-first, modular approach to chemical kinetics simulation. Large-scale benchmarks and Bayesian hierarchical validation demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and practical exploration of chemical kinetics, transforming a longstanding theoretical promise into a working engine for discovery.", "published": "2025-10-24", "categories": ["physics.chem-ph", "cs.LG", "cs.SE", "physics.atom-ph", "physics.data-an"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21368v1", "primary_category": "physics.chem-ph"}

In \\textit{Symbolic Neural Generators} (SNGs), symbolic learners examine logical specifications of feasible data from a small set of instances -- sometimes just one. Each specification in turn constrains the conditional information supplied to a neural-based generator, which rejects any instance violating the symbolic specification. Like other neurosymbolic approaches, SNG exploits the complementary strengths of symbolic and neural methods. The outcome of an SNG is a triple $(H, X, W)$, where $H$ is a symbolic description of feasible instances constructed from data, $X$ a set of generated new instances that satisfy the description, and $W$ an associated weight. We introduce a semantics for such systems, based on the construction of appropriate \\textit{base} and \\textit{fibre} partially-ordered sets combined into an overall partial order, and outline a probabilistic extension relevant to practical applications. In this extension, SNGs result from searching over a weighted partial ordering. We implement an SNG combining a restricted form of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) with a large language model (LLM) and evaluate it on early-stage drug design. Our main interest is the description and the set of potential inhibitor molecules generated by the SNG. On benchmark problems -- where drug targets are well understood -- SNG performance is statistically comparable to state-of-the-art methods. On exploratory problems with poorly understood targets, generated molecules exhibit binding affinities on par with leading clinical candidates. Experts further find the symbolic specifications useful as preliminary filters, with several generated molecules identified as viable for synthesis and wet-lab testing.", "published": "2025-10-27", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.NE", "q-bio.BM", "I.2.6; I.2.1; J.3"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23379v1", "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
