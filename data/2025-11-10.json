Nevertheless, training these models on complex problems remains challenging, often leading to limited accuracy and efficiency. In this work, we introduce a hybrid adaptive sampling and weighting method to enhance the performance of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The adaptive sampling component identifies training points in regions where the solution exhibits rapid variation, while the adaptive weighting component balances the convergence rate across training points. Numerical experiments show that applying only adaptive sampling or only adaptive weighting is insufficient to consistently achieve accurate predictions, particularly when training points are scarce. Since each method emphasizes different aspects of the solution, their effectiveness is problem dependent. By combining both strategies, the proposed framework consistently improves prediction accuracy and training efficiency, offering a more robust approach for solving PDEs with PINNs.", "published": "2025-11-07", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "physics.comp-ph"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05452v1", "primary_category": "stat.ML"}

Our 1D U-Net architecture with Feature-wise Linear Modulation learns to map desired angular scattering patterns to 2x2 dielectric sphere structure, naturally handling the non-uniqueness of inverse problems by sampling diverse valid designs. Trained on 11,000 simulated metasurfaces, the model achieves median MPE below 19% on unseen targets (best: 1.39%), outperforming CMA-ES evolutionary optimization while reducing design time from hours to seconds. These results demonstrate that employing diffusion models is promising for advancing electromagnetic inverse design research, potentially enabling rapid exploration of complex metasurface architectures and accelerating the development of next-generation photonic and wireless communication systems.

However, fragmented datasets, inconsistent annotations, and the lack of standardized benchmarks hinder computational approaches and slow down the discovery of new candidates. To address these challenges, we present the Expanded Standardized Collection for Antimicrobial Peptide Evaluation (ESCAPE), an experimental framework integrating over 80.000 peptides from 27 validated repositories. Our dataset separates antimicrobial peptides from negative sequences and incorporates their functional annotations into a biologically coherent multilabel hierarchy, capturing activities across antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and antiparasitic classes. Building on ESCAPE, we propose a transformer-based model that leverages sequence and structural information to predict multiple functional activities of peptides. Our method achieves up to a 2.56% relative average improvement in mean Average Precision over the second-best method adapted for this task, establishing a new state-of-the-art multilabel peptide classification. ESCAPE provides a comprehensive and reproducible evaluation framework to advance AI-driven antimicrobial peptide research.", "published": "2025-11-06", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "q-bio.BM", "68T07, 62H30, 62P10", "I.2.6; I.2.1; I.5.1; I.5.2"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04814v1", "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
